These are the same folks who've ruined the family farm and who try to destroy farmers who don't play by their rules of production. 

Science Mag published a paper in June stating:   It shows that animal farming takes up 83% of the worldâs agricultural land, but delivers only 18% of our calories. A plant-based diet cuts the use of land by 76% and halves the greenhouse gases and other pollution that are caused by food production. 

Becoming a vegetarian - or even just reducing meat/dairy consumption - would pretty much save the planet. From Earth Day dot org...  

If over the course of a year you:

* Ate one less burger a week, it would be the equivalent of taking your car off the road for 320 miles.
* Skip meat and cheese one day a week with your family, it would be the equivalent of taking your car off the road for five weeks â or reducing everyoneâs daily showers by 3 minutes.
* Skip steak once a week with your family, it would be the equivalent of taking your car off the road for nearly three months.
* And if the entire U.S. did not eat meat or cheese for just one day a week, it would be the equivalent of not driving 91 billion miles â or taking 7.6 million cars off the road.

We've been trained to be meat consumers (nom nom nom bacon) and brainwashed to think that our main source of protein comes from meat (nonsense).

Also, take note that this article is written for a more generalised audience, so don't expect too much detail. 

This is the paper's abstract:
""It has long been assumed that p53 suppresses tumor development through induction of apoptosis, possibly with contributions by cell cycle arrest and cell senescence1,2. However, combined deficiency in these three processes does not result in spontaneous tumor formation as observed upon loss of p53, suggesting the existence of additional mechanisms that are critical mediators of p53-dependent tumor suppression function3,4,5. To define such mechanisms, we performed in vivo shRNA screens targeting p53-regulated genes in sensitized genetic backgrounds. We found that knockdown of Zmat3, Ctsf and Cav1, promoted lymphoma/leukemia development only when PUMA and p21, the critical effectors of p53-driven apoptosis, cell cycle arrest and senescence, were also absent. Notably, loss of the DNA repair gene Mlh1 caused lymphoma in a wild-type background, and its enforced expression was able to delay tumor development driven by loss of p53. Further examination of direct p53 target genes implicated in DNA repair showed that knockdown of Mlh1, Msh2, Rnf144b, Cav1 and Ddit4 accelerated MYC-driven lymphoma development to a similar extent as knockdown of p53. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that extensive functional overlap of several p53-regulated processes safeguards against cancer and that coordination of DNA repair appears to be an important process by which p53 suppresses tumor development.""",1448,t3_8qcm6i,e0ipjyy,1528769144,1532448560,False

&gt;Living fossils are survivors of previously more diverse lineages that originated millions of years ago and persisted with little morphological change. Therefore, living fossils are model organisms to study both long-term and ongoing adaptation and speciation processes. However, many aspects of living fossils evolution and their persistence in the modern world remain unclear. Here, we investigate three major aspects of the evolutionary history of living fossils: cryptic speciation, population genetics, and effective population sizes; using members of the genera Nautilus and Allonautilus as classic examples of true living fossils. For this, we analyzed genome-wide ddRAD-Seq data for all six currently recognized nautiloid species throughout their distribution range. Our analyses identified three major allopatric Nautilus clades: a South Pacific clade, subdivided into three subclades with no signs of admixture between them; a Coral Sea clade, consisting of two genetically distinct populations with significant admixture; and a widespread Indo-Pacific clade, devoid of significant genetic substructure. Within these major clades we detected five Nautilus groups, which likely correspond to five distinct species. With the exception of Nautilus macromphalus, all previously described species are at odds with genome-wide data, testifying to the prevalence of cryptic species among living fossils. Detailed FST analyses further revealed significant genome-wide and locus-specific signatures of selection between species and differentiated populations, which is demonstrated here for the first time in a living fossil. Finally, approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) simulations suggested large effective population sizes, which may explain the low levels of population differentiation commonly observed in living fossils.

**Background**
Dementia is a prevalent condition, affecting 5â7% of people aged 60 years and older, and a leading cause of disability in people aged 60 years and older globally. We aimed to examine the association between alcohol use disorders and dementia risk, with an emphasis on early-onset dementia (&lt;65 years).

**Methods**
We analysed a nationwide retrospective cohort of all adult (âĽ20 years) patients admitted to hospital in metropolitan France between 2008 and 2013. The primary exposure was alcohol use disorders and the main outcome was dementia, both defined by International Classification of Diseases, tenth revision discharge diagnosis codes. Characteristics of early-onset dementia were studied among prevalent cases in 2008â13. Associations of alcohol use disorders and other risk factors with dementia onset were analysed in multivariate Cox models among patients admitted to hospital in 2011â13 with no record of dementia in 2008â10.

**Findings**
Of 31 624 156 adults discharged from French hospitals between 2008 and 2013, 1 109 343 were diagnosed with dementia and were included in the analyses. Of the 57 353 (5Âˇ2%) cases of early-onset dementia, most were either alcohol-related by definition (22 338 [38Âˇ9%]) or had an additional diagnosis of alcohol use disorders (10 115 [17Âˇ6%]). Alcohol use disorders were the strongest modifiable risk factor for dementia onset, with an adjusted hazard ratio of 3Âˇ34 (95% CI 3Âˇ28â3Âˇ41) for women and 3Âˇ36 (3Âˇ31â3Âˇ41) for men. Alcohol use disorders remained associated with dementia onset for both sexes (adjusted hazard ratios &gt;1Âˇ7) in sensitivity analyses on dementia case definition (including Alzheimer's disease) or older study populations. Also, alcohol use disorders were significantly associated with all other risk factors for dementia onset (all p&lt;0Âˇ0001).

**Interpretation**
Alcohol use disorders were a major risk factor for onset of all types of dementia, and especially early-onset dementia. Thus, screening for heavy drinking should be part of regular medical care, with intervention or treatment being offered when necessary. Additionally, other alcohol policies should be considered to reduce heavy drinking in the general population.",3,t3_7z5k5t,dulfwtn,1519220219,1520080299,False

25061,25062,"*College* guys who didn't want to have sex? I have a hard time believing this about any guys, but college is a sex rollercoaster at a sex carnival. Every guy I knew was looking to stick it in anything that moved, even if they had to keep quiet about it later to not get razzed. The only sex I've ever turned down was a few times when the woman was crazypants or nasty. It wasn't difficult. I could understand this if it was about getting boxed in at work somehow by a female superior who could fire you, but who are these guys in the article who, ""once a sexual interaction starts with a partner who seems to want sex, the desire to keep the exchange on an even keel eventually facilitates unwanted sex""? Why were they starting a sexual interaction in the first place if they didn't want sex? I mean are we talking like ""no, just a handjob, thanks""? I guess I just can't imagine that.

And how about this guy:

&gt; When a girl comes on to you, youre just like ok, Ill accept this because that almost never happens, in my experience at least, described a third. So, I guess that was a lot of why I went ahead with it.

Well... yeah? I mean, that is the more rare scenario, and it's awesome when it happens and it's an opportunity. You want to high five yourself. But I don't understand going through with it if it was someone you didn't want. 

I guess I was and am in a different mindset, particularly in college. I'd be interested to know if this title is representative of a widespread phenomenon or would be better written as ""*Some* men have unwanted sex...""",-6,t3_7g7sxm,dqhimvl,1511921143,1513108483,True

&gt; Cumulative cultural evolution occurs when social traditions accumulate  improvements over time. In humans cumulative cultural evolution is  thought to depend on a unique suite of cognitive abilities, including  teaching, language and imitation. Tool-making New Caledonian crows show  some hallmarks of cumulative culture; but this claim is contentious, in  part because these birds do not appear to imitate. One alternative  hypothesis is that crowsâ tool designs could be culturally transmitted  through a process of *mental template matching*. That is, individuals could use or observe conspecificsâ tools, form a mental  template of a particular tool design, and then reproduce this in their  own manufacture â a process analogous to birdsong learning. Here, we  provide the first evidence supporting this hypothesis, by demonstrating  that New Caledonian crows have the cognitive capacity for mental  template matching. Using a novel manufacture paradigm, crows were first  trained to drop paper into a vending machine to retrieve rewards. They  later learnt that only items of a particular size (large or small  templates) were rewarded. At test, despite being rewarded at random, and  with no physical templates present, crows manufactured items that were  more similar in size to previously rewarded, than unrewarded, templates.  Our results provide the first evidence that this cognitive ability may  underpin the transmission of New Caledonian crowsâ natural tool designs. ",8,t3_8usulr,e1hwkm5,1530279718,1533060049,False

Objectives. To estimate the risk of mortality from police homicide by race/ethnicity and place in the United States.

Methods. We used novel data on police-involved fatalities and Bayesian models to estimate mortality risk for Black, Latino, and White men for all US counties by Census division and metropolitan area type.

Results. Police kill, on average, 2.8 men per day. Police were responsible for about 8% of all homicides with adult male victims between 2012 and 2018. Black menâs mortality risk is between 1.9 and 2.4 deaths per 100 000 per year, Latino risk is between 0.8 and 1.2, and White risk is between 0.6 and 0.7.

Conclusions. Police homicide risk is higher than suggested by official data. Black and Latino men are at higher risk for death than are White men, and these disparities vary markedly across place.

Public Health Implications. Homicide reduction efforts should consider interventions to reduce the use of lethal force by police. Efforts to address unequal police violence should target places with high mortality risk. (Am J Public Health.

Summary

&gt; Background

&gt; Air particulate matter is a ubiquitous environmental exposure associated with oxidation, inflammation, and age-related chronic disease. Whether particulate matter is associated with loss of bone mineral density and risk of bone fractures is undetermined. We did two independent studies with complementary designs, objectives, and measures to determine the relationship between ambient concentrations of particulate matter and bone health.

&gt; Methods

&gt; In the first study, we examined the association of long-term concentrations of particulate matter less than 2Âˇ5 Îźm (PM2Âˇ5) and osteoporosis-related fracture hospital admissions among 9Âˇ2 million Medicare enrollees (aged âĽ65 years) of the northeast-mid-Atlantic USA between January, 2003, and December, 2010. In the second study, we examined the association of long-term black carbon and PM2Âˇ5 concentrations with serum calcium homoeostasis biomarkers (parathyroid hormone, calcium, and 25-hydroxyvitamin [25(OH)D]) and annualised bone mineral density over 8 years (baseline, November, 2002âJuly, 2005; follow-up, June, 2010âOctober, 2012) of 692 middle-aged (46Âˇ7 years [SD12Âˇ3]), low-income men from the Boston Area Community Health/Bone Survey (BACH/Bone study) cohort. PM2Âˇ5 concentrations were estimated using spatiotemporal hybrid modelling including Aerosol Optical Depth data, spatial smoothing, and local predictors. Black carbon concentrations were estimated using spatiotemporal land-use regression models.

&gt; Findings

&gt; In the Medicare analysis, risk of bone fracture admissions at osteoporosis-related sites was greater in areas with higher PM2Âˇ5 concentrations (risk ratio [RR] 1Âˇ041, 95% CI 1Âˇ030 to 1Âˇ051). This risk was particularly high among low-income communities (RR 1Âˇ076, 95% CI 1Âˇ052 to 1Âˇ100). In the longitudinal BACH/Bone study, baseline black carbon and PM2Âˇ5 concentrations were associated with lower serum parathyroid hormone (Î˛=â1Âˇ16, 95% CI â1Âˇ93 to â0Âˇ38, p=0Âˇ004, for 1 IQR increase [0Âˇ106 Îźg/m3] in the 1-year average of black carbon concentrations; Î˛=â7Âˇ39, 95% CI â14Âˇ17 to â0Âˇ61, p=0Âˇ03, for 1 IQR increase [2Âˇ18 Îźg/m3] in the 1-year average of PM2Âˇ5 concentrations). Black carbon concentration was associated with higher bone mineral density loss over time at multiple anatomical sites, including femoral neck (â0Âˇ08% per year for 1 IQR increase, 95% CI â0Âˇ14 to â0Âˇ02) and ultradistal radius (â0Âˇ06% per year for 1 IQR increase, â0Âˇ12 to â0Âˇ01). Black carbon and PM2Âˇ5 concentrations were not associated with serum calcium or serum 25(OH)D concentrations.

&gt; Interpretation

&gt; Our results suggest that poor air quality is a modifiable risk factor for bone fractures and osteoporosis, especially in low-income communities.

25141,25142,"From the paper:

&gt;Four pieces of music were selected, which were of different emotional valence (positive, negative) and arousal (low, high). The details of the music pieceâs title, composer, and average root mean square (RMS) amplitude can be found in [Table 1](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/figure/image?size=large&amp;id=info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0182210.t001).

So this could also be worded as, listening to Vivaldi's Four Seasons helped people think creatively. 

Their classification system is informed by another paper titled [Emotional Valence and Arousal Interact in Attentional Control](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-9280.2008.02082.x).  Which I unfortunately cannot view due to a paywall.

&gt;The selected music pieces have been validated by earlier research to promote a particular mood [36].

From what I can see I can tell that it was an experiment to see if people identified different images in a rapid sequence after they'd been primed into a certain mood.   There they used what they called standard induction procedure to induce moods.  That technique is outlined [here](https://www.nature.com/protocolexchange/protocols/2336) and music is only a part of it.  

&gt;For the positive mood induction: ask subjects to âselect the happiest piece of musicâ and have them listen to both Piano Concerto No. 4, Op. 58 in G Major: III. Rondo: Vivace by Ludwig van Beethoven; Serenade No. 13 KV 525 G-Major: I. Serenade. Allegro by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. Do not name the pieces, simply ask them to select piece 1 or 2.

This isn't my field in the slightest but it feels like there are a lot of assumptions being made in their procedure.  As well 121 of their 155 participants are also female, which it seems completed the experiment for course credit with an average age of 22.3.  So not a varied group in the slightest.

25166,25167,"Hello there!  (Long wind warning!)

The question before my long winded talk:  What's the correct approach on discipline for an autistic child?  That's broad I know...

I have a 3 year old son who is autistic.  It's still too early to see how this will affect him in the long term with his independence.  But a little info on him as I love talking about my kids and may hone in on my broad question a bit more...

He's now starting to say words but not in a communicating way.  He will read and surprises us all the time with saying words he reads without ever being prompted or told what the word is.  (We think he's [hyperlexic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperlexia) as he has picked up reading pretty much on his own)  He will occasionally ""ask"" for food by saying the food he wants.  (Peanut ""bubber"" is his favorite)  Otherwise, he generally just brings you food items he finds on the counter for help getting food.

He is very cuddly and does not shy away from physical contact.  The cuddly part being he actually seeks it out.  I understand that to be not as common.  So far, he has not displayed any sensory issues.  

He also doesn't mind just going on his own...  Which translates to running away in the middle of a crowd/running out into a street and him being none the wiser he's lost or doing anything wrong/scary.  He's very content on being alone and without mom and dad so that's scary to say the least. In the least, he likes to hold hands when we're out.

That's a brief introduction to our little man.  :)  Obviously way more to him than that intro.  Majority of the time, he's awesome.  (well, all the time he's awesome...)  But listening is definitely something that he does not do well.  Getting his attention to let him know he's doing something wrong does not really work...  He associates the word ""no"" as negative in most situations as ""no"" is the first thing that is spoken as he looks like he's going to dive off the couch/break something.  I'll be getting onto his older or younger brother (he's the middle child) and if ""no"" is involved, you can see him get frustrated and upset.  Relaying that point to him does not work as communication is not his forte.  Usually displays his frustration by swinging his arms and occasionally slapping the top of his head with both hands.  (Not excessively, just in the moment of frustration)

What's the correct approach on discipline???  He's far from a ""hellion"" and I don't think that's just from my parent's eyes either.  We get compliments all the time on how well our kids behave.  I just worry of him running out into traffic or just away and getting lost.  Of course, we're vigilant parents I would like to think...  But not perfect.  Maybe it will just take time...  But I do wonder if there's a good method of disciplining that may actually connect the dots on this behavior (or any other bad behavior) and reach a positive outcome?  

It's hard to word what I'm asking...  So I'll just post this and see what you have to say if you answer.  :)  Thanks!

How do you respond to people that believe, as Matt Ridley presented to the Royal Society last year (link below), that science has not provided sufficient evidence to suggest that global climate change is inherently dangerous? On a related point, what is your opinion on openness in scientific discourse to allow those that might not disagree with the science but instead disagree with the extent of the forecasted danger? I say that with the fact in mind that there have been calls by some to not allow ""climate denier scientists"" to speak at scientific conferences. Lastly, how do you respond to those that believe that money has tainted scientific objectivity by linking the livelihoods of researchers to their field, creating an incentive for dramatized predictions. If the future of a PI's research didn't rely on continuously obtaining grants, would the same dire pictures of the future still be forecasted?

25254,25255,"The recidivism rate among ex-felons is so high because society has made it almost impossible for an ex-felon to lead a normal life. First of all, let's exclude crimes like rape, murder, and assault where the criminal has shown an inability to function in normal society anyway. Instead, look at the people convicted of anyone of a number of nonviolent felonies that are on the books. Once these people finish their sentence, they are still being punished by society. The ease of background checks on the internet make getting a job of any kind a near impossibility. Years ago, a company would have to pay a detective agency a lot of money to conduct these checks by hand. They were only conducted on new hires where it was really necessary. Now any 12 year old with WiFi and $30 can do a thorough background check on anyone. Finding housing is extremely hard as well since most landlords conduct background checks as well and have a blanket policy against renting to felons, regardless of what the felony actually was. Not many felons are lucky enough to own their own property, so they are stuck renting from or living with friends and family which inevitably strains those relationships. Since they can't find work, many felon try their hand at starting their own business but find many occupations are closed to them. We are talking about any occupation that requires licensing and/or bonding through the state or some occupational organization. So most respectable trades are out the window, even things as mundane as a license to cut peoples hair is off the table (yes you need a license to legally cut hair for a living). Some of the felons may get lucky and be able to work for a friend or family member that owns their own company but that is by far the minority of situations. So what you are left with is a person who is expected to function is normal society that can't find work, cant find housing, and can't start a legitimate business. The felony becomes essentially a life sentence and suddenly committing more crimes (potentially worse crimes) starts looking like the best way to get ahead. If we want people to go straight and not commit more crimes, then we can't make it impossible to succeed. At least for first time non-violent offenders, we as a society need these people a break and create a mechanism, that isn't impossible to qualify for, to remove the felony from their record at least as far as non-law enforcement can see.

It's definitely helped. The exercise helps when I'm doing it. There's meaning behind the research of course.

And it's pretty discouraging seeing that these two things, diet and exercise, should be making my life sunshine and rainbows every where I go. I think selling realistic expectations of realistic effects would be helpful for those like me who can't be completely cured by diet and exercise. It would help us stick with it long term.

At least here in Ontario, in order to teach anywhere up to grade 10 (although realistically only up to grade 8 since its unlikely youll get a high school position in this case) you only need to have one teachable subject qualification.

Often there are dedicated science teachers for grade 7 &amp; 8 since they are commonly in a separate school (ie middle school), but realistically up to grade 6 (approximately age 11) math and science are taught by teachers who have no background in science or math. 

I have no statistics to back this up, but anecdotally I would pretty much guarantee that at least 90-95% of primary teachers have a degree in the arts or social science - which means that the majority of them likely havent taken any science or math classes since they were around 15 years old. These are teachers who are often terrified of math and science, they hate both having to know it and even more so teaching it. 

These are the people who are teaching kids math and science up to the age of 1112 - and we wonder why there is no interest, no understanding, and often an absolute disdain for math and science.  Theyve been taught to fear and hate it by teachers who, unwittingly, have passed on their own dislike of the subjects. 

As a high school teachers, its incredibly frustrating to, year after year, have entire classes of students who already hate the subject. They dont care. Too much effort is put into trying to foster an interest in the subject before we can even start to effectively teach them - let alone fixing the mistakes theyve already learned from teachers who couldnt be bothered to properly learn what they are supposed to be teaching.

&gt;**Abstract**

&gt;During the âGreen Saharaâ period (11,000 to 5000 years before the present), the Sahara desert received high amounts of rainfall, supporting diverse vegetation, permanent lakes, and human populations. Our knowledge of rainfall rates and the spatiotemporal extent of wet conditions has suffered from a lack of continuous sedimentary records. We present a quantitative reconstruction of western Saharan precipitation derived from leaf wax isotopes in marine sediments. Our data indicate that the Green Sahara extended to 31Â°N and likely ended abruptly. We find evidence for a prolonged âpauseâ in Green Sahara conditions 8000 years ago, coincident with a temporary abandonment of occupational sites by Neolithic humans. The rainfall rates inferred from our data are best explained by strong vegetation and dust feedbacks; without these mechanisms, climate models systematically fail to reproduce the Green Sahara. This study suggests that accurate simulations of future climate change in the Sahara and Sahel will require improvements in our ability to simulate vegetation and dust feedbacks.

Abstract

For 2 decades, science teachers have been encouraged to orient their instruction around the practices of scientific inquiry; however, it is unclear whether teachers have the knowledge and skills to do so. In this study, we draw upon data from the 2011 National Assessment of Educational Progress to examine the extent to which eighth-grade science teachersâ educational backgrounds are related to using inquiry-oriented instruction. We focus on aspects of teachersâ educational backgrounds that are most frequently used by teacher education programs and state licensing agencies as proxies for teachersâ content knowledge and professional preparation to teach science. We find that teachersâ educational backgrounds, especially in science and engineering disciplines and science education, are associated with differences in the extent to which teachers engage in inquiry-oriented instruction, regardless of teaching experience. Findings suggest that teachersâ educational backgrounds are relevant considerations as standards-based efforts to reform science instruction in middle-level classrooms move forward.",21,t3_8vrgjr,e1pn4gb,1530617642,1535612862,False

Am doctor. These statements can be misleading to the lay public. Interrupting a patient does not necessarily mean that you are not allowing them to set an agenda, nor does it imply that you are not listening. As a professor of clinical medicine, OP, you may be familiar with the manner in which docs take a history - there are specific parameters and procedures applied to corral the conversation from the realm of just that - conversation - to clinical information.

For example, we typically begin with a chief complaint. You cannot take a paragraph of verbiage and whittle it down to a CC on your own, it is responsible to ask pointed, probing questions. Often, this requires interrupting patients, and more often, we are forced by the constraints of our working environment and our feeble bodies made of meat and our poor depleted resources to do things at a pace which is greater that we might desire. Itâs a bad compromise, but it is a reality and reality is where medicine is practiced. Do I malign this reality? Sure, itâs miserable, but these are the conditions under which we become physicians - at least where I live.

Now for the agenda - i think this might be a stupid concept. In my experience, the agenda is set by the patient or by what is going on with the patient. Patient-centered care is important but anything that approaches typical customer service in this context is folly and not likely to improve outcomes. There are indications for hospitalization. There are things insurance and the government wonât pay for. To pretend like what the patient wants and what the patient needs are equivalent concerns is wrong. 

Iâm not saying âwho cares what they wantâ but often patient expectations are inappropriately inflated by the corporate/non medical side of medicine. My patients are important to me, and doing the best that I can to make them feel listened to is important. Billboards for cancer centers that use loaded terms like âcureâ, for example. On a side note, I feel that most marketing I see for healthcare is morally reprehensible due to the disparity of knowledge at play.

It is not possible to run the analysis without the system requirements, i.e. provide the respective requirements for python or even better provide the docker file to setup the respective environment. Not possible to run the analysis right now

**[3] Provide the results**

Results are missing from the repository, i.e., numerical result files as well as code for analysis of the results.

If you're doing what this quote says, you open yourself up for manipulation. And that is a big no no.

The paper is basically a mirror.

People who think climate change is man-made are doing this exact thing. They measure most recent feedback and apply this same ""recent feedback"" logic, that this paper is trying to ascribe to *deniers*, onto their measurements.

People who believe it was not an inside job took the thing as ""the most recent feedback"" logic, not taking into account what other things that and previous administrations did.

You shut the door on the What Ifs, you open yourself to ""the most recent feedback"" trap. So, a healthy dose of What Ifs is necessary in order to come to the truth. We've been lied to too many times by now to outright disregard any such *conspiracy theory*.

**Abstract**

&gt; Social rejection is a distressing and painful event that many people must cope with on a frequent basis. Mindfulness â defined here as a mental state of receptive attentiveness to internal and external stimuli as they arise, moment-to-moment â may buffer such social distress. However, little research indicates whether mindful individuals adaptively regulate the distress of rejectionâor the neural mechanisms underlying this potential capacity. To fill these gaps in the literature, participants reported their trait mindfulness and then completed a social rejection paradigm (Cyberball) while undergoing functional MRI. Approximately one hour after the rejection incident, participants reported their level of distress during rejection (i.e., social distress). Mindfulness was associated with less distress during rejection. This relation was mediated by lower activation in the left ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC) during the rejection incident, a brain region reliably associated with the inhibition of negative affect. Mindfulness was also correlated with less functional connectivity between the left VLPFC and the bilateral amygdala and the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, which play a critical role in the generation of social distress. Mindfulness may relate to effective coping with rejection by not over-activating top-down regulatory mechanisms, potentially resulting in more effective long-term emotion-regulation.",20,t3_8rgw24,e0r88ir,1529121327,1532599035,False

For example, this idiotic tax raise won't affect me at all. I'm working on a PhD and I'm a military veteran from Texas. Texas has a law called the Hazelwood Act, which is a supplement to the federal GI Bill (pays for college for military veterans) for back when the GI Bill sucked. It simply says that veterans are exempt from paying tuition at state universities. No money changes hands anywhere, so I don't even have a tuition waiver, I just don't get charged tuition to begin with. Many universities could do the same thing for all graduate students who have jobs as teaching assistants or research assistants. The university accountants might not like it, but it could work.

Of course, the other option is just to pay the teaching assistants and research assistants more to compensate. The fact that full-time research scientists and engineers get paid $20,000/year is pathetic to begin with.

Abstract

Studies showing that scepticism about anthropogenic climate change is shaped, in part, by conspiratorial and conservative ideologies are based on data primarily collected in the United States. Thus, it may be that the ideological nature of climate change beliefs reflects something distinctive about the United States rather than being an international phenomenon. Here we find that positive correlations between climate scepticism and indices of ideology were stronger and more consistent in the United States than in the other 24 nations tested. This suggests that there is a political culture in the United States that offers particularly strong encouragement for citizens to appraise climate science through the lens of their worldviews. Furthermore, the weak relationships between ideology and climate scepticism in the majority of nations suggest that there is little inherent to conspiratorial ideation or conservative ideologies that predisposes people to reject climate science, a finding that has encouraging implications for climate mitigation efforts globally.",27,t3_8hw2gr,dymx7uv,1525780543,1527219733,False

25571,25572,"This study has a couple funny things about it.

First, the idea that the study was placebo controlled. There is literally a chart showing that the subjects on the drug reported feeling the adderall high and the ones on placebo did not report any high. This chart is basically saying everyone broke the blind. The placebo is useless. That said, it probably didn't have much effect on the study, unless you want to argue that those on Adderall intentionally did worse than those on placebo, which would be a strange claim.

The second strange thing is the assertion that Adderall works differently for people with ADHD and those without. They provide no evidence for this, it's just an assertion. The analogy to glasses is false and not even an appropriate analogy. That analogy would only work if people who didn't need glasses lost their hearing when they wore glasses unnecessarily (and also got improved eyesight). Because Adderall improves focus and the study seems to show it decreases working memory tasks, which is not a new finding. The authors seem to be absolutely convinced that ADHD users of Adderall do not suffer the same decrease in working memory ability, yet their is no evidence of that in their study or elsewhere. It's an assertion based on blind faith that the drug ""treats"" ADHD. It's unscientific.",2,t3_90jucv,e2shz7d,1532196072,1536347885,False
25572,25573,"I study sea turtles. First, a minor clarification to the title - sex ratio is highly female-skewed *at certain beaches.* 

It has always been the case that some beaches closer to the equator (warmer beaches) produce predominantly females, while other beaches farther from the equator, especially the âpolar-mostâ beaches at the very fringe of the nesting range for certain species, produce mostly males. For instance in the US it has long been the case that southern Florida beaches produce mostly females while the North Carolina area produces most of the males (for loggerheads &amp; greens).

Whatâs happening now is a sudden skew in ratios at both types of beaches, the mostly-female beaches going to all-female and the mostly-male beaches going to approx 50:50. The question is, can sea turtles alter nest depth or shift âpolarwardâ to establish new male-producing nest sites, i.e. colonizing new beaches that havenât been used before. Some recent studies have found that females at the âhotâ beaches are indeed digging deeper (cooler) nests, apparently in a response to sand temperature, but that this is only partially effective (i.e. even the deep nests produce mostly females. Those deeper nests do produce a couple more males, but not enough to ensure optimum fertility of all females). 

However, sea turtles are also shifting their range. For instance in the US, Assateague Island (Maryland) just had its first loggerhead nest, which produced 100 hatchlings, likely predominantly males. Kempâs ridleys too are coming out of the Gulf of Mexico &amp; starting to move up the eastern seaboard, and encouragingly Texas had a record number of Kempâs nests last year (they usually nest in Mexico). 

But a considerable problem here is that turtles are moving into areas that have not historically had them and that therefore donât have basic protections set up to help nesting turtles. Cape Cod has been overwhelmed by a huge influx of young Kempâs ridleys that end up stranded on the northern shore, in enormous numbers recently. Re nest habitat generally though, sandy beaches are usually intensely developed for human recreation and baby sea turtles donât fare well with the âcoastal roads + strip of houses + strong street lightsâ setup that we humans tend to put along most beaches. 

This is one (of many) examples of species trying to shift their range in response to climate change, but in the process leaving the southern wildlife refuges &amp; policies that had been set up to help them, and moving into more northern areas where no such protections yet exist. There is an interesting issue here of species moving faster than wildlife policy can keep up. (Same issue is occurring w N Atlantic right whales btw, which have just moved out of fisheries/shipping zones that were carefully arranged to not overlap w the whales, and into Canadian waters with no such regulations, the result being the worst die-off ever recorded, last summer. Ships smashing into them left &amp; right, whales with horrific entanglements washing up dead. The Canadians have not had right whales up there before so it just took them all by surprise.)

Anyway, sea turtle survival may eventually depend on residents of mid-latitude beaches that have not historically had turtles being willing to rapidly change beach lighting/traffic policy to encourage sea turtle nesting. These mid-latitude beaches are the ones that can produce the males in the future. For example, US coastal residents in Maryland, Virginia &amp; Long Island can help by watching for turtle nests &amp; reducing lighting when nests occur. Though... the pace of change may become so rapid that we may need to move eggs, physically, to northern beaches so that those individual hatchlings will imprint on northern beaches. This is known as âassisted migrationâ and it may become essential, especially when the beaches themselves start moving/flooding as sea level really begins to change.

tl;dr - This is solvable if turtles can move to different nest sites, but we may need to help them move.",26569,t3_7q7rmw,dsn72oi,1515891018,1517870397,False

Discussion from Emanuel (2017):

&gt;Over the coming decades, one may reasonably expect the quality of hurricane track forecasts to continue to improve, and advances in model resolution, physics, and data assimilation may finally lead to substantial improvements in storm intensity forecasts. At the same time, projected increases in coastal population will continue to expose more and more people to tropical cyclone hazards, making preparations and evacuations more difficult and costly. The present work suggests that the incidence of storms that intensify rapidly just before landfall could increase substantially by the end of this century, and as rapid intensification is difficult to forecast, there is a risk of an increased frequency of poorly anticipated, high-intensity landfalls, leading to higher rates of injury and death. This, coupled with rising sea levels, suggests that greater emphasis be placed on improving hurricane intensity prediction and on preparing populations to respond to high-intensity landfalling hurricanes at short notice.",2,t3_6wk9ha,dm8m1p0,1503935744,1504453267,False

25644,25645,"I was diagnosed with testicular cancer almost five years ago. I was 27 and life was great, I was working reasonable hours and there was this girl I was really starting to fall for. We had been friends forever but had not seen each other for quite a while, then we started to reconnect. Then I found a lump on my nut. Surgery to remove testicle, and three months of pretty intensive chemo because the cancer had made its way into lymph nodes in my body.

For me, the PTSD/anxiety/depression came after my treatments. The new cancer free me wasn't quite like the old pre cancer me. A couple of things stand out, (had no feeling in my tips of fingers for a while, had bad blot clots in my arm where I'd have the IV put in, digestion system seemed out of whack) but most notable for me was my ""libido"". It was not the same at all and it affected my confidence in a big way. I gave up on the girl in a romantic context. It felt like I had been stripped of my manhood. I also felt totally mentally drained, with many lows and highs back to back in a short time frame. The girl moved away and I lost a good portion of the support I could lean on. 

Three months after being told I was in remission I was incredibly depressed(not a shred of happiness for a year) and super stressed out that cancer would come back. I became hypersensitive to the point of being a hypochondriac. Every little tingle or discomfort was cancer. I was totally aware that I was losing my mind thinking this way, but I could not silence voice in the back of my mind. I started doing lots of drugs to not only silence these voices but also to feel at least an inkling of joy in what seemed like absolute misery.

It took me four years to get out of that, but I did it. I just wanted to say that you should always seek help if you have the opportunity. Leave your ego at the door and do it. I didn't and it caught me off guard and ate me alive.
Also know if you don't seek help, you can still get out of it. It took me a long time and a lot of pain, but if I can do it, anyone can.

25670,25671,"Abstract:

&gt; This paper is one of the first systematic assessments of ex-felonsâ workplace performance. Using FOIA-requested data from the Department of Defense, we follow 1.3 million ex-offender and non-offender enlistees in the US military from 2002 to 2009. Those with a felony background show no difference in attrition rates due to poor performance compared to those without criminal records. Moreover, ex-felons are promoted more quickly and to higher ranks than other enlistees. At the same time, we find that ex-felons are slightly more likely to commit a legal offense in the military system (5 percent of non-felons compared to 6.6 percent of ex-felons). We also find a higher rate of work-related deaths among the ex-felon sample; closer evaluation of limited data suggests this may be driven by ex-felons being assigned more often to combat positions. Overall, our study shows that the militaryâs criminal history screening process can result in successful employment outcomes for ex-felons, at least in terms of job mobility and reliability, to the mutual benefit of employer and employee. An important question arising from this analysis is whether the militaryâs âwhole personâ review can apply successfully to the civilian sector.

&gt;Men who consume more pornography are more likely to say they are dissatisfied with the amount of variety in their sex life and the amount of time spent on sex.

&gt;The study, recently published in the Journal of Social and Personal Relationships, investigated the relationship between sexual satisfaction and viewing different types of sexual content.

&gt;âIt seems logical that viewing a sports illustrated swimsuit edition is going to influence expectations of sexuality differently than viewing mainstream pornography. It also seems logical that satisfaction with sexual variety is not necessarily the same thing as satisfaction with love and affection in the sexual relationship,â explained study author Nathan D. Leonhardt of Brigham Young University.

&gt;âYet, nobody has studied how viewing distinct types of sexual content might differ in influencing different aspects of sexual satisfaction.â

&gt;âIn our study, we wanted to start a more comprehensive discussion of how sexual content influences sexual satisfaction,â Leonhardt told PsyPost. âWe evaluated how both mainstream pornography, with explicit depiction of sexual acts, and non-explicit provocative sexual media, focused on women, were associated with several aspects of sexual satisfaction (time spent on foreplay, variety, overall satisfaction, frequency, love and affection, time spent on intercourse), for both men and women.â

&gt;The study surveyed 858 individuals in committed romantic relationships about their exposure to mainstream heterosexual pornography and other forms of sexually provocative media, such as an image of a woman in her underwear in a provocative pose.

&gt;The researchers found that men who watched more pornography tended to also be more dissatisfied with the amount of variety in their sex life and more dissatisfied with the amount of time spent on intercourse.

&gt;âPornography use was connected to lower satisfaction with sexual variety and satisfaction with time spent on intercourse, but only for men,â Leonhardt explained. âIt makes sense that pornography would be more likely to influence satisfaction with sexual variety and time spent on intercourse than viewing provocative sexual media, as pornography actually depicts explicit sexual acts.â

&gt;âPerhaps men who view pornography are disappointed in their partnersâ lack of ability or desire to perform the sexual acts portrayed in pornography,â he continued. âIt was interesting that this only held true for men. This is just supposition, but perhaps the negative connection was not there for women because their male partners are more willing to engage in the sexual acts depicted in pornography.â

&gt;However, more frequent pornography use was not associated with lower overall sexual satisfaction for men or women.

&gt;When it came to non-explicit provocative media of women, Leonhardt and his colleague found some evidence that it was associated with problems among the female participants.

&gt;âFor both men and women, use of provocative sexual media was negatively connected to satisfaction with love and affection in the sexual relationship; we suspect this is due to the objectifying nature of the content. It could be difficult to establish a sexual relationship built on love and affection if individuals accept a message of sexuality without identity,â Leonhardt explained.

&gt;âInterestingly, provocative sexual media was particularly problematic for women, as it was also connected to lower satisfaction with sexual variety, overall sexual satisfaction, and satisfaction with time spent on intercourse. We suspect that womenâs provocative sexual media use could be leading to a greater likelihood of self-objectification, which could negatively influence sexuality in a variety of ways.â

&gt;âOverall, our study highlighted the complexity of the connection between viewing sexual content and sexual satisfaction, but provided insight into the nuances by clarifying which aspects of sexual satisfaction are connected to viewing specific types of sexual content,â Leonhardt told PsyPost.

&gt;The study used a cross-sectional design, meaning the researchers cannot draw conclusions about cause and effect.

&gt;âThe first major caveat is that we cannot claim causality,â Leonhardt said. âWe cannot be sure which variables are actually influencing the others. Take the negative connection between menâs use of pornography and satisfaction with sexual variety as an example. The association may be due to men being disappointed in being unable to participate in sexual acts depicted in pornography.â

&gt;âYet another equally plausible explanation is that men who are dissatisfied with the variety in their sexual relationship are looking at pornography in an attempt to find new ideas for sexual practices.â


&gt;The research still leaves some questions unanswered.

&gt;âAnother major caveat is that our data did not consist of both partnersâ perspectives,â Leonhardt said. âIt would be helpful to see how these results might differ based on evaluating both partnersâ moral approval of viewing sexual content, and the extent to which couples are viewing the content together.â

&gt;âWe hope our study opens the door to exploring additional nuances in how the type of sexual content viewed influences differing types of sexual satisfaction,â he added. âOn a practical note, those who view sexual content should carefully consider the messages presented, and whether those messages align with what they ultimately are pursuing in a sexual relationship.â

&gt;The study, âPornography, provocative sexual media, and their differing associations with multiple aspects of sexual satisfactionâ, was co-authored by Brian J. Willoughby.",187,t3_7inmce,dr01n2v,1512837776,1514522415,False

**Abstract:**

&gt;Theria comprises all but three living mammalian genera and is one of the most ecologically pervasive clades on Earth. Yet, the origin and early history of therians and their close relatives (i.e., cladotherians) remains surprisingly enigmatic. A critical biological function that can be compared among early mammal groups is mastication. Morphometrics and modeling analyses of the jaws of Mesozoic mammals indicate that cladotherians evolved musculoskeletal anatomies that increase mechanical advantage during jaw rotation around a dorsoventrally-oriented axis (i.e., yaw) while decreasing the mechanical advantage of jaw rotation around a mediolaterally-oriented axis (i.e., pitch). These changes parallel molar transformations in early cladotherians that indicate their chewing cycles included significant transverse movement, likely produced via yaw rotation. Thus, I hypothesize that cladotherian molar morphologies and musculoskeletal jaw anatomies evolved concurrently with increased yaw rotation of the jaw during chewing cycles. The increased transverse movement resulting from yaw rotation may have been a crucial evolutionary prerequisite for the functionally versatile tribosphenic molar morphology, which underlies the molars of all therians and is retained by many extant clades.",2,t3_6196a8,dfcn11x,1490365122,1491750028,False

**Abstract**

We aimed to examine the relationship between religion and suicide attempt and ideation. Three hundred twenty-one depressed patients were recruited from mood-disorder research studies at the New York State Psychiatric Institute. Participants were interviewed using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM Disorders, Columbia University Suicide History form, Scale for Suicide Ideation, and Reasons for Living Inventory. Participants were asked about their religious affiliation, importance of religion, and religious service attendance. **We found that past suicide attempts were more common among depressed patients with a religious affiliation (odds ratio, 2.25; p = 0.007). Suicide ideation was greater among depressed patients who considered religion more important (coefficient, 1.18; p = 0.026) and those who attended services more frequently (coefficient, 1.99; p = 0.001)**. We conclude that the relationship between religion and suicide risk factors is complex and can vary among different patient populations. Physicians should seek deeper understanding of the role of religion in an individual patientâs life in order to understand the personâs suicide risk factors more fully.",8,t3_5pxscp,dcun8n3,1485282591,1486402927,False

&gt; We find that while fermentable (inulin), but not insoluble (cellulose), fiber markedly protected mice against high-fat diet (HFD)-induced metabolic syndrome, the effect was not significantly impaired by either inhibiting SCFA production or genetic ablation of GPR43. Rather, HFD decimates gut microbiota, resulting in loss of enterocyte proliferation, leading to microbiota encroachment, low-grade inflammation (LGI), and metabolic syndrome. Enriching HFD with inulin restored microbiota loads, interleukin-22 (IL-22) production, enterocyte proliferation, and antimicrobial gene expression in a microbiota-dependent manner, as assessed by antibiotic and germ-free approaches.

According to [US News](https://health.usnews.com/health-news/blogs/eat-run/2015/05/05/what-is-inulin-chicory-root-fiber), chicory is a common source of inulin in the food industry but it can be found in several foods.  However, they caution:

Abstract

&gt; Using artificial intelligence (AI) to prevent and treat diseases is an ultimate goal in computational medicine. Although AI has been developed for screening and assisted decision-making in disease prevention and management, it has not yet been validated for systematic application in the clinic. In the context of rare diseases, the main strategy has been to build specialized care centres; however, these centres are scattered and their coverage is insufficient, which leaves a large proportion of rare-disease patients with inadequate care. Here, we show that an AI agent using deep learning, and involving convolutional neural networks for diagnostics, risk stratification and treatment suggestions, accurately diagnoses and provides treatment decisions for congenital cataracts in an in silico test, in a website-based study, in a âfinding a needle in a haystackâ test and in a multihospital clinical trial. We also show that the AI agent and individual ophthalmologists perform equally well. Moreover, we have integrated the AI agent with a cloud-based platform for multihospital collaboration, designed to improve disease management for the benefit of patients with rare diseases.

&gt; Artificial intelligence (AI) holds great promise in computational medicine. Much attention has been focused on creating an expert medical robot with all-round ability and high diagnostic accuracy. However, a doctorâs process in determining medical diagnoses and treatments is so complex that it is difficult to fully model and simulate using conventional algorithms and data. Moreover, mistakes regarding vital decisions are not acceptable. An attractive alternative use of AI is in the reduction of costs and in improving the efficiency of the medical process 1 . Several AI algorithms have been developed for medical purposes, such as screening, risk stratification and assisted decision-making 2,â3,â4 . However, the systematic application of AI to a specific medical problem remains difficult, even more so if the application has to perform well within the constraints of clinical practice.

&gt; Rare diseases, which affect approximately 10% of the worldâs population, can be life-threatening or chronically disabling 5 . The current approach to addressing these diseases involves combining medical resources to establish specialized care centres 6 . However, these centres are tremendously expensive and geographically scattered, with weak connections to non-specialized hospitals, where care for these patients is relatively poor 7 . Therefore, missed or mistaken diagnoses, as well as inappropriate treatment decisions, are common among rare-disease patients and are contrary to the goals of precision medicine, especially in developing countries with large populations, such as China 8,9 .

&gt; Congenital cataracts (CC) is a typical rare disease that causes irreversible vision loss 10 . Breakthroughs related to CC have contributed substantially to medical science 11,â12,â13 . Current management of CC requires timely intervention to remove the cloudy lens and rigorous follow-up to manage postoperative complications 14 . Therefore, CC, which jointly combines the characteristics of acute and chronic diseases, is a suitable test case for the exploration of a health management system for rare diseases.

&gt; To explore the feasibility of applying AI to the management of rare diseases, we used deep-learning algorithms to create CC-Cruiser, an AI agent involving three functional networks: (i) identification networks for screening for CC in populations, (ii) evaluation networks for risk stratification among CC patients, and (iii) strategist networks to assist in treatment decisions by ophthalmologists. The AI agent showed promising accuracy and efficiency in silico. We also conducted a multihospital clinical trial, website-based study and a âfinding a needle in a haystackâ test to validate its versatility and utility. We then performed a test to compare the real-world performance of CC-Cruiser with individual ophthalmologists. We also established a cloud-based AI platform for rare diseases, and propose an operating mechanism for multihospital collaboration.",2,t3_5r3ujf,dd474n2,1485813283,1486568903,False

Abstract

&gt; Monoclonal antibody 10-1074 targets the V3 glycan supersite on the HIV-1 envelope (Env) protein. It is among the most potent anti-HIV-1 neutralizing antibodies isolated so far. Here we report on its safety and activity in 33 individuals who received a single intravenous infusion of the antibody. 10-1074 was well tolerated and had a half-life of 24.0 d in participants without HIV-1 infection and 12.8 d in individuals with HIV-1 infection. Thirteen individuals with viremia received the highest dose of 30 mg/kg 10-1074. Eleven of these participants were 10-1074-sensitive and showed a rapid decline in viremia by a mean of 1.52 log10 copies/ml. Virologic analysis revealed the emergence of multiple independent 10-1074-resistant viruses in the first weeks after infusion. Emerging escape variants were generally resistant to the related V3-specific antibody PGT121, but remained sensitive to antibodies targeting nonoverlapping epitopes, such as the anti-CD4-binding-site antibodies 3BNC117 and VRC01. The results demonstrate the safety and activity of 10-1074 in humans and support the idea that antibodies targeting the V3 glycan supersite might be useful for the treatment and prevention of HIV-1 infection.",29,t3_5okdz8,dcjy2on,1484683867,1486130539,False

25890,25891,"It would be really cool if we could combine this technology with current engines. In one method, we could use the alternating electric field near the high pressure compressor in order to heat the gas before it gets to the combustor. This would improve the fuel efficiency of the engine (though the plane would need a lot more power output). Also the electrical components will be greatly affected by the heat unless sufficiently cooled. We cool the fan blades by pumping cold fuel through them (little fuzzy about this), if we could place the electrical components inside the fanblades and near the coolant, that might solve the problem.

Another method is to use the alternating field to accelerate the exhaust gas, thereby increasing the gas' exit velocity and making the plane able to travel faster with the same fuel. Again, there is a power detriment to the system.

In the paper it talks about how it takes a lot of power just to start the process. Maybe in the future we have the planes connected to a power cable on the runway that provides enough power to start the system. Then when the plane is warmed up, the cable detatches and the plane takes off.

Abstract: 

Hunger, caused by mild amount of food deprivation, is an everyday physiological state familiar to us all. Ongoing research has pinpointed the way hunger affects people's physiological functions as well as their attitudes and allocation of attention toward domain-specific, food-related objects. Yet, little is known about the way food deprivation affects basic perceptual abilities. Here, we utilized size-contrast visual illusions commonly associated with food to explore the way deprivation affects relative processing of food size. In two experiments (Nexp1âŻ=âŻ32 females, mean age: 24.31; Nexpt2âŻ=âŻ41 females, 40 males, mean age: 23.84), we examined the effect food deprivation has on participantsâ susceptibility to the Delboeuf illusion, which biases the perceived size of a neutral or of a food-related object when it is placed within the context of another object (e.g., a pizza is perceived as smaller when placed on a larger plate or tray). The results showed that food deprivation reduces the illusory bias for food-related but not for neutral stimuli. Such reduction in the illusory effect indicates reliance on analytic, rather than on relative processing style, for domain-specific stimuli when in the state of hunger.

&gt; Evidence on the comparative cost-effectiveness of alcohol control strategies is a relevant input into public policy and resource allocation. At the global level, this evidence has been used to identify so-called best buys for noncommunicable disease prevention and control. This article uses global evidence on alcohol use exposures and risk relations, as well as on intervention costs and impacts, to re-examine the comparative cost-effectiveness of a range of alcohol control strategies.
&gt; 
&gt; **Method**:
&gt; A âgeneralizedâ approach to cost-effectiveness analysis was adopted. A new modeling tool (OneHealth) was used to estimate the population-level effects of interventions. Interventions that reduce the harmful use of alcohol included brief psychosocial interventions, excise taxes, and the enactment as well as enforcement of restrictions on alcohol marketing, availability, and drink-driving laws. Costs were estimated in international dollars for the year 2010 and effects expressed in healthy life years gained. Analysis was carried out for 16 countries spanning low-, middle-, and high-income settings.
&gt; 
&gt; **Results**:
&gt; Increasing excise taxes has a low cost (&lt;I$0.10 per capita) and a highly favorable ratio of costs to effects (&lt;I$100 per healthy life year gained in both low- and high-income settings). Availability and marketing restrictions are also highly cost effective (&lt;I$100 in low-income settings and &lt;I$500 in high-income settings). Enforcement of drink-driving laws and blood alcohol concentration limits via sobriety checkpoints had cost-effectiveness ratios in the range of I$1,500â3,000. Brief psychosocial treatments were &lt;I$150 and &lt;I$1,500 in low- and high-income settings, respectively.

Here in Belgium, if a doctor deems us unfit for work - because we're in too bad a shape or because we're contagious - he'll write a note stating why we're unable to work (sickness / accident / surgery), an estimation of duration and whether we're allowed to leave the house.

Then, our employer pays up to the first 30 (thirty !) consecutive days of our sick leave. That's full pay. Should it last over 30 days, we drop to our (obligatory, single payer) health insurance. That's not full pay, but generally enough to get by.

In addition, it is something that could easily be replicated/challenged/confirmed by poorer sections of the world - since many people in those areas routinely already get TB vaccination (because of prevalent TB).  Although common use of BCG in such populations may itself have a bias effect - as Type-1 populations may only be those which were not helped by BCG.

- [Also see the more active r/diabetes thread on this study](https://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes/comments/8st7ta/a_centuryold_tuberculosis_vaccine_shows_promise/

[This comment there may sum up what this study may be about (though I could be incorrect):](https://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes/comments/8st7ta/a_centuryold_tuberculosis_vaccine_shows_promise/e13ggis/)

&gt;So yes, all cells process sugars like glucose or fats for energy. But the way they do it depends on the cell and circumstance. The way BCG May help people w/ T1D is a certain cell type that is involved with autoimmune reaction switches to a more âhungryâ form of metabolism when exposed to the Tb-like vaccine - which utilizes more sugar for more energy production than before, lowering blood sugar.
&gt;
&gt;Specifically, immune cells called lymphocytes are switching from oxidative phosphorylation to aerobic glycolysis.
&gt;
&gt;Hope this helps! (I wrote the WBUR article). Iâm not a doc but Iâve got a degree in human biology if that matters.

&gt;US researchers found that just one jab, followed by a booster four weeks later, **brought down average blood sugar levels to near normal within three years, and the effect lasted for the following five years**.
&gt;
&gt;âIn addition to the clinical outcomes, we now have a clear understanding of the mechanisms through which limited BCG vaccine doses can make permanent, beneficial changes to the immune system and lower blood sugars in type 1 diabetes.â
&gt;
&gt;The team also discovered that **the jab speeds up the rate by which cells convert glucose into energy and tests on mice show that it could also be beneficial against Type 2 diabetes.**
&gt;
&gt;The new study involved 52 people with Type 1 diabetes. After three years of treatment average blood sugar levels had dropped by 10 per cent and by 18 per cent after four years. Treated participants had an average blood glucose score of 6.65, close to the 6.5 considered the threshold for diabetes diagnosis.
&gt;
&gt;In comparison, the blood sugar of those in the placebo group continued to rise over the trial period.
&gt;
&gt;Prof Andrew Hattersley FRS, Professor of Molecular Medicine, University of Exeter Medical School, said if it was proven to be effective **it would be a âmajor advance,' but warned it had only been proven in a few people**.


Paper:

- [Long-term reduction in hyperglycemia in advanced type 1 diabetes: the value of induced aerobic glycolysis with BCG vaccinations](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41541-018-0062-8)

&gt;The BCG impact on blood sugars appeared to be driven by a novel systemic and blood sugar lowering mechanism in diabetes. We observe a systemic shift in glucose metabolism from oxidative phosphorylation to aerobic glycolysis, a state of high glucose utilization. Confirmation is gained by metabolomics, mRNAseq, and functional assays of cellular glucose uptake after BCG vaccinations. To prove BCG could induce a systemic change to promote accelerated glucose utilization and impact blood sugars, murine data demonstrated reduced blood sugars and aerobic induction in non-autoimmune mice made chemically diabetic. BCG via epigenetics also resets six central T-regulatory genes for genetic re-programming of tolerance. These findings set the stage for further testing of a known safe vaccine therapy for improved blood sugar control through changes in metabolism and durability with epigenetic changes even in advanced Type 1 diabetes.
&gt;
&gt;The 8 year long followed and BCG-treated T1Ds showed a reduction in HbA1c levels of greater than 10% after year 03, 18% at year 04, and the HbA1c remained low for the next 5 years (pâ=â0.0002 at year 8) (Fig. 1a, b). Subject numbers and traits are given in Supplementary Table S1a, S2. In contrast, the placebo group (nâ=â3) and the reference T1D groups (nâ=â40) had consistently higher HbA1c over the entire monitoring period of 8 years and 5 years, respectively (Fig. 1a, b, Supplementary Table S2).

In fact it was shown that when an older organism is infused with a young and healthy blood plasma, it demonstrates some reverse processes of ageing.

The same happened in an experiment were a young and older mice bloodstreams are interconnected https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23872599

Similar results are observed, when young blood or specific protein groups are taken from young mammals and infused into any other species of older mammals.

First, I'm curious about applying a similar kind of method to national borders. For example, if you expanded the boundaries of your map beyond the US to include Canada and Mexico, what would this look like? I recognize that incorporating illegal entry could make this work complicated (and politicized). But thinking about geography, citizenship, and belonging and the ways socio-cultural borders of belonging can be porous when political borders are not this kind of mapping is really interesting. Have you tried applying this to international borders? 

Second, I'd love to see utilization of this kind of mapping for ethnic borders and boundaries. Since ethnic groupings and borders do not depend upon political ones, it would be interesting to see how self identified ethnic communities are mapped onto contemporary American political boundaries and how they migrate/commute/return. But ideally this would be using data that is better than the Census, which is obviously limited and problematic for identifying ethnic communities especially sub-groups within larger categories.

Title: Residual Strength and Durability of Volcanic Ash Concrete Exposed to High Temperature
Author(s): Khandaker M. A. Hossain and Mohamed Lachemi

Abstract:
The strength and durability performance of concretes incorporating 0 to 40% of volcanic ash (VA) as cement replacement (by mass) subjected to high temperatures up to 800 Â°C (1472 Â°F) is described. The strength properties were assessed by unstressed residual compressive strength, while durability was investigated by rapid chloride permeability test (RCPT), mercury intrusion porosimetry (MIP), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and crack pattern observations. Volcanic ash concrete (VAC) showed good performance showing higher residual strength, higher chloride resistance and higher resistance against deterioration particularly at temperatures below 600 Â°C (1112 Â°F) compared with the control ordinary portland cement (OPC) concrete. The improved performance of VAC can be attributed to the refinement of pore structure, lowering the presence of free chloride due to Friedelâs salt formation and pozzolanic action due to the presence of VA. The deterioration of both strength and durability of VAC increased with the increase of temperature up to 800 Â°C (1472 Â°F) due to substantial reduction in residual strength and an increase in pore volume and pore diameter. The serviceability assessment of VAC after a fire should therefore, be based on both strength and durability considerations.",5,t3_7vvrn3,dtw1228,1518029130,1519022355,False

2.) Was the firearm legally owned and possessed?

Why is this in r/science? It was done with the direct intent of finding some evidence of discrimination. The methods with which they've gathered the data is suspect.

and

&gt; This produced 24 studies containing 30 estimates of discrimination against African Americans and Latinos since 1989, together representing 54,318 applications submitted for 25,517 positions. Finally, we performed a random-effects meta-regression to identify trends over time. 

So they only targeted ""ethnic"" sounding names and the data was gathered from studies **since** 1989. If the data has been collected over a 30 year period and was filtered by names rather than a persons actual race, the ""evidence"" can't be used to say, ""Now in 2017, whites receive 36% more callbacks than blacks.""

That finding is absolutely not what they uncovered or could logically conclude.

Clearly this study was done in order to provide ""evidence"" of a false narrative that gives credence to ethnic and gender studies ""scientists"" that have nothing better to do with their time than claim victimhood and possible justify their tragic mistake of choosing a non-STEM field to pursue as a career.

Definition of conspiracy:

""a secret plan by a group to do something unlawful or harmful.""

To think that groups within and outside our government who have power (see: money) do not use that power to conspire in order to maintain and improve the magnitude of that power is ludicrous and goes against all precedence.

However, there are many who make people who research conspiracies look bad by not utilizing critical thinking. With the abundance of misinformation and disinformation it is important to utilize the utmost disgression when considering conspiracies and to discuss them thoroughly and only make bold statements of their validity when concrete evidence can be provided.

26358,26359,"&gt; To achieve this, Professor Bo Chen and colleagues first induced division of MĂźller glia in healthy mice by injecting a gene into the eye that activates a protein called beta-catenin.
&gt; Once the cells had divided, factors that prompt the cells to turn into rod photoreceptors were injected into the eyes and the new rods were tracked using microscopy.
&gt; Chen and team report that the regenerated rod photoreceptors appeared to have the same structure as naturally occurring photoreceptors.
&gt; They had also formed synaptic structures that enabled them to communicate with other retinal neurons.
&gt; To test whether the newly formed rods were functional, the researchers applied the approach to blind mice that had been born without functional rods.
&gt; They found that the rods derived from MĂźller glia developed just as well as they had in the healthy mice and were communicating with other types of neurons in the retina across synapses.

I work with Majorana fermions (theoretically). To put this into context:

[This research](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature26142) provides very high quality experimental evidence for the existence of Majorana bound states.

Majorana bound states arise in certain superconductors. Superconductivity is an inherently quantum mechanical phenomenon, where electrons form pairs, which then do weird quantum stuff. So, if you want to build a quantum computer, superconductors are a good place to look.

Describing majorana bound states as a ""half-electron"" is a bit, well, not quite misleading, but not a good idea either. For instance, they have no electric charge. A more accurate description would be: A majorana bound state is to an electron what the real and imaginary part are to a complex number.

The fact that Majorana bound states could be useful for quantum computation was first pointed out by [A. Kitaev in 2000][1]. This was a fairly theoretical idea until, in 2010, there were [two][2] [suggestions][3] that Majorana fermions should be present in certain systems that we can actually realize in the laboratory. Early reports, [like in 2012][4], claimed to have done this, but the evidence was not that good. Now it's 2018, and we're finally seeing high quality experiments that work as the theory suggested about a decade ago. So, yes, the progress is great, but it's been a long road almost 20 years in the making.

I've heard the story that some time after hearing about Majorana bound states, [Michael Freedman][5] approached Bill Gates and asked whether he would fund this approach to building a quantum computer. Today, Microsoft is indeed paying top dollar to pursue this. My guess is that it will still take &gt; 10 years to actually build a quantum computer.

Abstract: Background Age at natural menopause is a matter of concern for women of reproductive age as both an early or late menopause may have implications for health outcomes.

Methods: Study participants were women aged 40â65 years who had experienced a natural menopause from the UK Womenâs Cohort Study between baseline and first follow-up. Natural menopause was defined as the permanent cessation of menstrual periods for at least 12 consecutive months. A food frequency questionnaire was used to estimate diet at baseline. Reproductive history of participants was also recorded. Regression modelling, adjusting for confounders, was used to assess associations between diet and age at natural menopause.

Results: During the 4-year follow-up period, 914 women experienced a natural menopause. A high intake of oily fish and fresh legumes were associated with delayed onset of natural menopause by 3.3 years per portion/day (99% CI 0.8 to 5.8) and 0.9 years per portion/day (99%âCI 0.0 to 1.8), respectively. Refined pasta and rice was associated with earlier menopause (per portion/day: â1.5 years, 99%âCI â2.8 to â0.2). A higher intake of vitamin B6 (per mg/day: 0.6 years, 99%âCI 0.1 to 1.2) and zinc (per mg/day: 0.3 years, 99%âCI â0.0 to 0.6) was also associated with later age at menopause. Stratification by age at baseline led to attenuated results.

Conclusion: Our results suggest that some food groups (oily fish, fresh legumes, refined pasta and rice) and specific nutrients are individually predictive of age at natural menopause.

This study really only says that students who stay up late perform poorly in early classes and students who wake up early perform poorly in late classes. Shocking. 

So the solution is simple. College students struggling in classes due to âsleepinessâ should consider changing their sleep schedule around their own class schedule. Students who can not manage to do such a simple thing could use the lesson.

All they did was look for an area with lower cardiovascular issues and adopt that diet instead of studying exactly why. It turns out there are better diets based more closely on scientific literature on the topic. They basically found that the old  pyramid was pretty much inverted to what is should be.


The super TLDR version is basically:

First and foremost, dicipline yourself to gain some self control with your eating habbits. If you fail this you will do nothing but fail more as you try to change yourself and it'll discourage you from trying. This is a self indulgence that most Americans were trained to view as normal and it's not. You have to break that mold and insert your willpower in to the matter and take responsibility for that willpower's sucess and failure. Which is to say, your... sucesses and failures. And on top of that that's pretty much how you learn to deal with life. It's actually a good training tool for it because eating is something you're supposed to do every day, and you have to, and you want to. If you have to do it, you might as well do it in a way that helps you aim the right direction. 

Obviously of course this brings up the other end of the spectrum of under eating and all I can really say to that is that they aimed poorly. They aimed for a marketed body image, not a happy and more importantly healthy life. They need to master their addiction to this image and do what they can to discard it and replace it with a more reasonable scientific understanding of health and beauty. Also, do what they can to unburden themselves with the concept of the genetic predisposition they got handed in regards to their appearance and just work with what they've got and make it in to something that uniquely expresses them and their character. That's what's attractive to men. Sure frills and dresses are pretty, but that don't mean shit if the person it's hanging on is devoid of indivual character and principles by which they model their life. 

Minimize your sugar intake to more stable levels (you only need about a teaspoon in your blood stream at any given time and more is actually bad). Fruit is good but even fruit can be bad when over consumed.

Stick to mostly dark leafy greens and vegetables that are closer to organic and fresh and make this the majority of your diet.

Minimize bad carbs to as close to 0 as you can tolerate and aim for more whole and unprocessed grains if at all. 

Aim for healthier fats. Omega 3s and 6s and the like. Nuts, fish, extra virgin olive oil, coconut oil (actually stupidly healthy in organic unrefined form), and stay away from pretty much any saturated fat.

Lean protine, alot of fish, chicken, lean red meat cuts in moderation, beans, and various odds and ends sources.

And excersize on a routine to match your lifestyle. ",-24,t3_8vskjf,e1pxnbv,1530629522,1535617767,False

26438,26439,"&gt;The mean glyphosate level increased from 0.024ug/L in 1993-1996 to 0.314ug/L in 2014-2016, and reached 0.449ug/L in 2014-2016 for the 70 participants with levels above the LOD

The combined levels of gly+AMPA are less than 1ug/L which agrees pretty well with [this study from last year](http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/early/2016/03/30/ajcn.115.126854.abstract). In that study, they state:

&gt;Studies in humans show that 20% of diet-derived glyphosate is absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, with the remaining 80% excreted in the feces, and studies conducted with rats suggest that nearly all absorbed glyphosate is rapidly excreted unchanged in urine; little, if any, is metabolized to and excreted as AMPA. In fact, most AMPA in urine is thought to be the result of either the consumption of plants that havemetabolized glyphosate into AMPA and/or exposure to phosphonates found in detergents.

They go on to explain (emphasis mine):

&gt; It is noteworthy that **all measured urine glyphosate concentrations to date, even the highest, have not warranted a legitimate health concern** based on the European Food Safety Authorityâs allowable daily intakes and allowable operator exposure concentrations

In the discussion they make an estimate of risk (emphasis mine):

&gt;The RfD is an estimate of the quantity of a chemical that a person could be exposed to every day for the rest of his or her life with no appreciable risk of adverse health effects. **The RfD for glyphosate is 1.75g per kg per day**; this value is based on a âno-effectâ concentration in animals (175 mg per kg per day) with a 100-fold safety 
 actor (margin of exposure). The EPA considers AMPA to be of similar or lesser toxicity than glyphosate and 
 etermined in 1994 that it should be exempt from regulation regardless of concentrations observed in food or feed. Thus, **a 75-kg woman (typical weight for our studyâs participants) could consume as much as 131.25 mg glyphosate/d with no expected negative effects**. If 20% of dietary glyphosate is absorbed (i.e., 20% bioavailability) and 100% of absorbed glyphosate is excreted into urine, such an individual would be expected to excrete 26.25 mg/d (26,250 mg/d) glyphosate in her urine. In the current study, the highest reported urine glyphosate concentration was 1.93 mg/L. As such, even allowing for a relatively high urine output (3 L/d), the highest glyphosate excretion in our study would be 5.79 mg/d, a value 4500 times lower than that which would be expected if the hypothetical mother described previously had consumed the RfD for glyphosate.


So the levels reported in OP's article are far, far too low to be disconcerting. It makes sense that urinary levels have increased since 1993 because [glyphosate has replaced more dangerous herbicides since then](https://geneticliteracyproject.org/2016/11/02/gmos-food-pesticides-101-no-chemical-flood-yields-rising/).",6,t3_78hif6,dou06pr,1508874146,1510146071,False

Ultra-high thermal effusivity materials for resonant ambient thermal energy harvesting.

Abstract

&gt; Materials science has made progress in maximizing or minimizing the thermal conductivity of materials; however, the thermal effusivityârelated to the product of conductivity and capacityâhas received limited attention, despite its importance in the coupling of thermal energy to the environment. Herein, we design materials that maximize the thermal effusivity by impregnating copper and nickel foams with conformal, chemical-vapor-deposited graphene and octadecane as a phase change material. These materials are ideal for ambient energy harvesting in the form of what we call thermal resonators to generate persistent electrical power from thermal fluctuations over large ranges of frequencies. Theory and experiment demonstrate that the harvestable power for these devices is proportional to the thermal effusivity of the dominant thermal mass. To illustrate, we measure persistent energy harvesting from diurnal frequencies, extracting as high as 350âmV and 1.3âmW from approximately 10âÂ°C diurnal temperature differences.",6,t3_7y69im,dudwt35,1518868697,1519330216,False

2. Do a masters

I spent all summer looking for a job - I found a database of all labs in my country and applied to each and every one of them through their careers section. I got one - yes, ONE - phone interview, and not-surprisingly I wasn't offered the job. I was offered a masters I was really excited for, but I couldn't afford it. Then I was offered the PhD, which luckily had already been granted funding so I said yes.

Abstract

Positive subjective perceptions of aging predict various well-being, physical health, mental health, and longevity outcomes. Thus, it is important to consider what factors contribute to their formation. Socioeconomic status (SES) has been hypothesized to be one such factor, but past research has been mixed. We propose that subjective assessments of SES may better predict subjective perceptions of aging than traditional objective measures (e.g., income and education). The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of objective and subjective indicators of SES on subjective perceptions of aging. Participants (n = 296) from the Mindfulness and Anticipatory Coping Everyday study were recruited with a Human Intelligence Task on Amazonâs Mechanical Turk. Participants reported on their SES (i.e., income, education, and subjective social status) and subjective perceptions of aging (i.e., attitudes toward own aging, subjective age, and awareness of age-related gains and losses). Data were analyzed via hierarchical multiple regression with demographic and health variables entered first, followed by income and education, then subjective social status. Results demonstrated that although objective measures of SES did not contribute to predicting subjective perceptions of aging, those who rated themselves subjectively higher in their community social standing were more likely to possess positive aging attitudes, younger subjective ages, more awareness of age-related gains, and fewer awareness of age-related losses. These findings suggest that perceptions of doing better than oneâs neighbors (i.e., âthe Jonesesâ) may matter more for understanding subjective perceptions of aging than objective indicators of social status.

Abstract:

A set of associated left pedal elements of a sauropod dinosaur from the Upper Jurassic Morrison Formation in Weston County, Wyoming, is described here. Several camarasaurids, a nearly complete small brachiosaur, and a small diplodocid have been found at this locality, but none match the exceptionally large size of the pedal elements. Next to the associated pedal elements, an isolated astragalus, phalanx and ungual were found, which match the large metatarsals in size. The elements cannot be ascribed to diplodocids due to the lack of a ventral process of metatarsal I. Moreover, the morphology of metatarsal V has a broad proximal end, with a long and narrow distal shaft, which differs from Camarasaurus. The size of the material and a medially beveled distal articular surface of metatarsal IV imply an identification as a brachiosaurid. This is the largest pes ever reported from a sauropod dinosaur and represents the first confirmed pedal brachiosaur elements from the Late Jurassic of North America. Furthermore, this brachiosaur material (the pes and the small nearly complete specimen) is the northernmost occurrence of brachiosaurids in the Morrison Formation.

Abstract

Does a senator's personal religion influence their legislative behavior in the Senate? To date, empirical research has answered this question only using senatorsâ religious traditions, while more concurrent work implies that religion should be measured as a multifaceted phenomenon. This study tests this proposition by compiling a unique data set of senatorsâ religion, conceptualized and measured by three different elementsâbelonging, beliefs, and behavior. The study estimates the association between these three religious facets and senatorsâ legislative behavior on economic, social, and foreign policy issues, while controlling for their constituenciesâ political and religious preferences. It finds that religious beliefs are a strong predictor of senatorsâ legislative behavior, while religious tradition and behavior are mostly not. Furthermore, it finds that religious beliefs are associated with legislative behavior across a wide array of policy areas and are not confined to sociocultural issues.

Abstract

Using a unique cross-sectional data set of dating website membersâ educational preferences for potential mates (N = 41,936), we showed that women were more likely than men to stipulate educational preferences at all ages. When members indifferent to educational level were excluded, however, the specificity of menâs and womenâs preferences did differ for different age groups. That is, whereas women expressed more refined educational preferences during their years of maximum fertility, their demand specificity decreased with age. Menâs specificity, in contrast, remained stable until the 40s, when it was greater than that of postreproductive women, and then was higher during their peak years of career-earnings potential. Further, when individualsâ level of education was controlled for, women (compared with men) were more likely to state a higher minimum preference for educational level in a potential mate.",8,t3_8u8por,e1deb38,1530097788,1532982094,False

Thanks for doing the AMA. 

I'm doing a PhD in AI fairness and I was wondering: 

1) How do you deal with performance gaps that may result from discrimination? 

To illustrate what I mean: Say group A typically has less access to education per capita than group B. As a result, group A then appears more sparsely in the applicant pool while also having non-typical backgrounds for various reason (socio-economical etc). Do you then try and hire group A more than group B in a sort of affirmative action to try and fix the problem? Do you take a disparate impact (80-20 rule stuff) approach to this?

2) How do you deal with deeply ingrained self-bias? For example I think there are studies that show when women try to qualify themselves for a new position, they tend to use past achievements as evidence, while men on the other hand, typically talk about their great potential for future achievement. I'm wondering if you have come across this type of phenomena as well and, if so, how do you approach devising a solution for it.

&gt; Commonly used interventions may fail with high\-risk men because they are likely to generate âhostility reactanceâ â one of the key causes of both sexual violence itself and the unintended adverse effects of the interventions.  

In the body of the paper, the authors state:

&gt;Given the fact that the broader literature on interventions has cautioned about the potential of boomerang effects and that this caution should have been reinforced by studies in related areas such as domestic violence, it might have been expected that researchers would have extensively considered and evaluated this possibility in the sexual assault intervention area. Unfortunately, there have been very few studies that have examined the effects of interventions on men who are at relatively high risk for sexual aggression. The few relevant studies we have found indeed should sound the alarm even more.  
&gt;  
&gt;We could not find any studies that specifically examined the impact of any elaborate interventions on high\-risk males. The studies we did find all involved some form of intervention of less than one hour. One of these was a systematic experiment using a well\-validated laboratory analogue of sexual aggression. In a community sample of American men, [Bosson, Parrott, Swan, Kuchynka, and Schramm (2015)](https://www-sciencedirect-com.proxy.uchicago.edu/science/article/pii/S1359178917303646#bb0030) found that men low in sexism showed less aggressive tendencies following exposure to messages emphasizing norms of gender equality (e.g., most men approve of âmen doing half of the housework and childcareâ) or paternalism (e.g., most men approve of âalways offering to pay when out to dinner with a womanâ). Conversely, men high in hostile sexist attitudes showed a boomerang effect of increased sexually aggressive tendencies.  
&gt;  
&gt;In a study of undergraduate men, [Stephens and George (2009)](https://www-sciencedirect-com.proxy.uchicago.edu/science/article/pii/S1359178917303646#bb0185) examined the impact of a rape prevention intervention on low\- vs. high\-risk men. Risk level was determined by whether individuals had reported previously engaging in sexually aggressive behavior. High\-risk men (45&amp;#37;) had reported at least one past sexually coercive act whereas the remaining 55&amp;#37; reported none. The intervention was a 50\-minute video that included various components. The researchers found that men in general showed reductions in rape myth acceptance and an increase in victim empathy at a five\-week follow\-up. Subgroup analyses, however, suggested that low\-risk men were responsible for these findings. High\-risk men showed no reliable attitudinal changes from the intervention. More alarmingly, high\-risk men in the intervention group were more likely at follow\-up to report higher sexually coercive behaviors than prior to the intervention.

In other words, evidence for ""hostility reactance"" mainly comes from changes in attitude following interventions against non\-sexual aggressive behaviors.  It might be a mistake to attribute increased sexually coercive behaviors to changes in attitude. 

In my opinion, these ""high risk"" sexual aggressors (more specifically, those with anti\-social personality disorder) lack empathy and do not care about right or wrong.  They only care about whether they can get what they want (e.g. sexual gratification) and whether they can get away with it.  If interventions highlight how easy it is to perpetrate and get away with rape, then of course these interventions will increase rape perpetrated by anti\-social males. 

Interventions that focus on bystander intervention reduce the probability that would\-be rapists will get what they want and increase the probability that would\-be rapists will be caught.  It's clear to me that this is why such interventions are more effective.  ",5,t3_8q5jxn,e0hf2r4,1528723510,1532426026,False

Abstract

&gt; Sequential evaluation is the hallmark of fair review: The same raters assess the merits of applicants, athletes, art, and more using standard criteria. We investigated one important potential contaminant in such ubiquitous decisions: Evaluations become more positive when conducted later in a sequence. In four studies, (a) judgesâ ratings of professional dance competitors rose across 20 seasons of a popular television series, (b) university professors gave higher grades when the same course was offered multiple times, and (c) in an experimental test of our hypotheses, evaluations of randomly ordered short stories became more positive over a 2-week sequence. As judges completed repeated evaluations, they experienced more fluent decision making, producing more positive judgments (Study 4 mediation). This seemingly simple bias has widespread and impactful consequences for evaluations of all kinds. We also report four supplementary studies to bolster our findings and address alternative explanations.

2. What's the role of telomeres in the process of your cellular homeostasis dogma of DNA&gt;RNA&gt;Protein? Because there has been a lot of research and popular interest in telomere length as a potential area of intervention to pause or reverse ageing. Again I ask from a position of ignorance.

Their network might be as comfortably compiled as the sheets used by a scientist in a laboratory. Bloggers and scientists act like they are masters of deceit and stealth, while they have never hurt a fly.  I wouldnât look at a human body and pretend to know where its best to start using my scalpel, yet people without experience in this âfieldâ act like they are professionals.

What I find when I talk to people about these subjects is that people ridicule the entire idea/ordeal first, put every piece of evidence in the coincidence or ad hominem box, and continue this stance throughout, all the while argumenting that 'official sources say otherwise' or 'everybody would have to be in on it'. Which are really stupid arguments. I take it we understand why the official sources argument is stupid, in regard to the 'everybody would have to be in on it' argument, consider this:

There is a war. There is a general. The general wants artillery. He has a whole strategic plan and this is part of it. He calls the commander, ""artillery at X5"", the commander, he knows a lot of this plan, he is the commander. The commander calls the squad leader ""artillery at X5!"". The squad leader knows less of the plan, he knows the most of the X region, where he has his lieutenant stationed with his artillery men, the lieutenant gets a call, he knows even less of this plan, and he hears the order ""artillery at X5"". The lieutenant puts in the coordinates, and yells 'FIRE!' The soldier, the one that actually fires the artillery, the one that commits murder, all he heard was 'FIRE!'. He knows the very least of the plan but still more than a citizen. In reality, in a real war, all this communication is encrypted, things function on a need to know basis, evidence is redacted, excuses are compiled.

So for example, if the moon landing video footage was faked, that doesn't mean everybody at NASA cooperated in the faking or knew about the plan to do so.

In a conspiracy, you would put in extra work to make sure you have the right excuses compiled, the right tools (ridicule, and/or the creation of a spokesperson to ridicule (Alex Jones), witnesses, comment-bots, all that. Not to mention ranks, departments, the need to know basis, money, death-treaths, etc.

Generally, if something is true, all evidence points towards it. In a conspiracy it is obviously a bit harder to get evidence, but when a lot of evidence is gathered, those researchers are called out on 'seeing too many connections that aren't there' when they have reached this point. Some Russian KGB agent whos name I forgot said something along the lines of ""we give them so much information that they don't know what to think"". Ridicule is a very useful tool to use to cover things up.

These kinds of vice taxes do not have citizens best interest at heart.

So the title OP chose undersells the potential of this discovery. Pretty much every galaxy had a supermassive black hole, millions of times the mass of the sun, at the center. And the evolution of a galaxy is considered to be tightly coupled to the evolution of the supermassive black hole.

But we don't really understand how these supermassive black holes form. One idea is that they begin to form in the very early universe before starts have formed by installing gas. Another idea is that they form ""hierarchically via repeated mergers of less massive objects. I.e., two stars merge to form a 2 solar mass black hole, which merged with another black hole to form a 4 solar mass black hole, etc. 

A prediction of the hierarchical merger scenario is the existence of ""intermediate mass"" black holes with several thousand times the mass of the sun. But there hasn't really been any definitive evidence of them. This study provides strong evidence for such an intermediate mass black hole. And that means evidence for the hierarchical merger scenario.

**Edit:** by the way, the detection method used here is really cool. But looking for light emitted by the gas, the authors watched the motion of the gas in the cloud and found it to make most sense of there was a black hole inside the cloud.

This isn't a perfect analogy but think about watching water in your bathtub after you pull the plug. You can tell where the drain is by watching the Whirlpool-the notion of the water. I say it's not an exact analogy because the black hole isn't actually consuming much of the gas in the cloud.",118,t3_6y795f,dmlc5l6,1504621782,1506509703,False

Abstract

A number of recent studies have implicated that incongruent use of hormonal contraceptives (HCs) negatively affects various aspects of women's romantic relationships. It has been suggested that women with incongruent HC use (a discrepancy in HC use status between when they first met their current partner and the time of study participation) report less sexual satisfaction and higher jealousy scores compared to women with congruent HC use. A similar effect has also been hypothesized for general relationship satisfaction, and recent findings suggest that the association between HC incongruency and women's general relationship satisfaction is moderated by third-party ratings of facial attractiveness of the women's male partners. Using a large convenience sample (N = 948) of Finnish women, we attempted to replicate previously reported findings but found no support for the HC congruency hypothesis, despite excellent statistical power (âĽ98.7%) to detect previously reported effect sizes. Instead, after dividing our sample into four groups based on HC congruency/incongruency, we found that the largest differences in jealousy, sexual satisfaction, and relationship satisfaction scores tended to be found between women who were consistent HC users and consistent non-users (i.e., between women with different kinds of congruent HC use). We also detected a significant main effect of current HC use on jealousy. We conclude that HC congruency effects reported in previous studies may have spuriously arisen from unequal distributions of current HC users within congruent and incongruent HC user groups.",105,t3_8q0k7g,e0fh9cn,1528634901,1532392126,False

Anarchists and tribals keep telling them, ""You have to be smarter than a chicken"", but academics never get it because, of course, they are paid to look the other way.

Machiavelli and all that romantic existentialist crap, makes a lot more sense when you comprehend the simple memory centric systems logics of a flock of chickens, but comparing politicians and academics to Vaudeville comedy was why they killed Socrates for merely asking questions and repeating a handful of lame jokes, and why Lao Tzu used a pseudonym and the most cryptic mysticism imaginable. Academics calling society corrupt means academics will have to look at their own practices, including how they are teaching people to compete for money instead of the benefits of listening to one another and cooperating. Teaching complete idiots with money how to destroy the planet faster and build more efficient walls between everyone. Recently, academics have even proposed censoring the internet to protect the public from themselves, because teachers inspire their students so much that one in five insists the sun revolves around the earth.

Abstract

&gt; Maternal immune activation has been highlighted as a factor that might increase the risk and severity of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in children. Preclinical animal evidence shows that immune activation in mothers during pregnancy causes ASD-like behavioural traits in offspring. To this point, there has been no investigation of whether immune system activation in human mothers during pregnancy is associated with more severe symptoms in children with ASD. In this study, data from an existing ASD cohort (N=220) were analysed to investigate whether immune conditions in the mother were associated with greater severity of autism-related symptoms. Results showed that children whose mothers reported a history of immune activation (allergies and asthma) had significantly higher scores on the Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS; P=0.016), suggesting more severe social impairment symptoms in these children. This increasing severity of social impairment symptoms was further shown on the SRS cognition (P=0.007) and mannerisms (P=0.002) subscales. While immune history was associated with an increase in the severity of social impairment symptoms, history of autoimmune conditions in the mother did not have any effect in this cohort. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to show an association between immune activation history in the mother and increased ASD symptom severity in children with ASD. These findings support the idea of an immune system-mediated subtype in ASD, where the immune history of the mother may be an important factor.",5,t3_75fx0a,do5v2g8,1507627811,1509692309,False

27077,27078,"Good morning Dara Shifrer.

Many years ago we adopted a severe special needs baby. Before we were allowed to adopt him my wife and I were required to go through a battery of interviews and a series of classes/seminars that ""prepared"" us for the inevitable issues that were likely to arise throughout life due to our choice in adopting him.

We've taken the surgeries (and still have at least 2 more) in stride. Although his speech can become garbled when he's super excited or tired he's done with speech therapy. One of his speech therapists at the school down the street kept pressuring us to enroll him in the group therapy program that was ran by the school district. According to the school district my son is labelled special needs and would require an IEP and sped time with other sped children.

In our usual social environment however my son thrives. Many of his peers/friends know about his ""disability"". We've taken to a Montessori style approach to his upbringing and education. There's a small but growing movement of us around the country. Many of the children (and their parents) have accepted that society as a whole will want to throw a label on us. While we're dealing with that we've also come to accept that not everybody will excel at everything. Rather than dwell (for example) on the fact that my son will have speech issues for his entire life we choose to focus on what makes him an awesome kid; the same as our peers/friends. We just got home from a very large conference in Tigard where most of the children either have been labelled or would most likely be labelled.

So my question based on all the above. Have you studied large groups of people (say over 500) with ""disabilities"" that decided to enjoy being who they are? Would you be interested in watching/learning this type of social interaction?",3,t3_6j0nk1,djart1u,1498230352,1499596486,False

At the same time, however, there is a group of dads who believe they are to be breadwinners, disciplinarians and nothing more.â


&gt; The study also showed a correlation between fathers who exhibit negative aspects of traditional masculinity and fathers who are less involved with their children.

Does Adherence to Masculine Norms Shape Fathering Behavior? 

Journal of Marriage and Family, 2018; 80 (3): 704 

DOI: 10.1111/jomf.12476

Link: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/jomf.12476

Abstract

Research suggests that many fathers struggle balancing hegemonic masculine norms with new fatherhood ideals. This study uses data on 2,194 fathers from a national study on fathers of children aged 2 to 18 and incorporates a comprehensive assessment of masculine norms to examine whether adherence to masculine norms is associated with father involvement and whether this relationship is mediated by fathers' adherence to the new fatherhood ideal that promotes engaged, nurturing parenting. Results suggest that fathers who more closely adhere to masculine norms are less involved in instrumental and expressive parenting and are more likely to engage in harsh discipline than fathers who are less masculine. Adherence to masculine norms also reduces the likelihood of embracing the new fatherhood ideal, and adherence to the new fatherhood ideal at least partially mediates the relationship between masculinity and father involvement. Overall, despite changing expectations for fathers, hegemonic masculine norms continue to shape fathers' behavior.

Update - since there are comments asking about the negative aspects of traditional masculinity, the article linked says this:

&gt; âItâs important to understand what masculinity is and is not,â Shafer said. âIn some circles, when people hear terms like hegemonic or toxic masculinity, they think those are attacking all men. Not so. There are some very beneficial aspects of masculinity â being goal-oriented or being loyal, for example. However, we are talking about more problematic aspects of masculinity â like aggression, detached relationships, not showing emotion and failing to ask for help. These are negative aspects of traditional masculinity, and our research suggests it hurts families.â

These trees from the picture certainly don't live in the (sub-)tropics, so this rule applies: The tree's shadows must fall to the north on the Northern Hemisphere and to the south on the Southern Hemisphere, respectively. So, if the trees really were to lean towards the equator, the would have to lean away from their shadows.

Other students studied the same lesson with instructions that they would later teach the material; of those expecting to teach, some participants actually taught the material by presenting a brief video-recorded lecture before being tested (teaching group), whereas others only prepared to teach before being tested (preparation group). Results of Experiment 1 indicated that both the preparation group and teaching group significantly outperformed the control group on an immediate comprehension test (Teaching vs. Control: d = 0.82; Preparation vs. Control: d = 0.59). However, when the same test was given following a one-week delay (Experiment 2), only the teaching group significantly outperformed the control group (Teaching vs. Control: d = 0.79; Preparation vs. Control: d = 0.24). Overall, these findings suggest that when students actually teach the content of a lesson, they develop a deeper and more persistent understanding of the material than from solely preparing to teach.

Man's primary lack that female association gives is beauty/sex. Especially at 23 years old.

Conversely, women tend to get a wider range of needs met by men, so the coin of value they will accept is more diverse.

This creates a sort of assymetry of value trading. Men end up with many ways to achieve value, but only at the upper end is any one single metric enough to be viable. They have to have a diverse portfolio, as it were.

Women, on the other hand, have fewer paths but their potency is considerably greater. Women's selection of mates opens up much more widely further down the curve of attractiveness than for men.

My best guess for why the less attractive female subjects were somewhat penalized for creativity is simply that they were offering, in context of these 23 year old respondent males, a product without a market.

Abstract

&gt; Progress towards the integration of technology into living organisms requires electrical power sources that are biocompatible, mechanically flexible, and able to harness the chemical energy available inside biological systems. Conventional batteries were not designed with these criteria in mind. The electric organ of the knifefish Electrophorus electricus (commonly known as the electric eel) is, however, an example of an electrical power source that operates within biological constraints while featuring power characteristics that include peak potential differences of 600 volts and currents of 1 ampere1,2. Here we introduce an electric-eel-inspired power concept that uses gradients of ions between miniature polyacrylamide hydrogel compartments bounded by a repeating sequence of cation- and anion-selective hydrogel membranes. The system uses a scalable stacking or folding geometry that generates 110 volts at open circuit or 27 milliwatts per square metre per gel cell upon simultaneous, self-registered mechanical contact activation of thousands of gel compartments in series while circumventing power dissipation before contact. Unlike typical batteries, these systems are soft, flexible, transparent, and potentially biocompatible. These characteristics suggest that artificial electric organs could be used to power next-generation implant materials such as pacemakers, implantable sensors, or prosthetic devices in hybrids of living and non-living systems3,4,5,6.",2,t3_7jr45q,dr8hhvi,1513252559,1514703851,False

27193,27194,"From actually reading the results of the study, a clarification;

The correlation is NOT that you're healthier when in a good relationship.

The correlation is that when relationships DETERIORATE, health status appears to as well. Likewise, when relationships IMPROVE, health does.

&gt;  Overall, among married men there were only very modest benefits in terms of CVD risk factors, if at all, when comparing men in persistently good or bad relationships. However, changes in marital quality had positive or negative effects on lipids and BP, as we had predicted a priori, and a modest degree of this may have been mediated through changes in adiposity

...

&gt; The similarity of CVD risk factors for men in persistently good and bad marriages suggests a number of possibilities; that quality of marital relationship is unimportant; that there could be some habituation after a period of timeâso the emotional effects of marital quality are no longer salient or reporting bias. Interestingly, the UK million women study failed to find any association between happiness and ischaemic heart disease mortality after appropriate adjustment, suggesting that a simplistic psychosocial explanation may be inadequate.

In other words; there's nothing there suggesting happiness is a factor, but rather there appears to be a benefit to the stability involved. Those with consistently positive OR negative relationships show more consistent readings indicating health. For married men, this consistency is maintained, but results also trend slightly healthier on average. However, all three showed a correlation between deteriorating relationships and deteriorating health, and improving relationships with improving health.",23,t3_77pnk6,doo9fle,1508572023,1510039837,False

**Abstract**

&gt; Uncertainty is a fundamental feature of human life that can be fractioned into two distinct psychological constructs: risk (known probabilistic outcomes) and ambiguity (unknown probabilistic outcomes). Although risk and ambiguity are known to powerfully bias nonsocial decision-making, their influence on prosocial behavior remains largely unexplored. Here we show that ambiguity attitudes, but not risk attitudes, predict prosocial behavior: the greater an individualâs ambiguity tolerance, the more they engage in costly prosocial behaviors, both during decisions to cooperate (experiments 1 and 3) and choices to trust (experiment 2). Once the ambiguity associated with anotherâs actions is sufficiently resolved, this relationship between ambiguity tolerance and prosocial choice is eliminated (experiment 3). Taken together, these results provide converging evidence that attitudes toward ambiguity are a robust predictor of oneâs willingness to engage in costly social behavior, which suggests a mechanism for the underlying motivations of prosocial action.",114,t3_8r83c4,e0p79hj,1529035494,1532564130,False

From the perspective of precision medicine, I completely agree that we need to do a better job of capturing natural population diversity in our genetics research.

From a basic biology perspective, how do you interpret results where an association in people of European ancestry fails to replicate in individuals of a different ancestry? For example, the first paper you link writes:

&gt; For example, for 25% of the variants in European Americans that GWAS have identified as being associated with body mass index, type 2 diabetes and lipid levels, the strength of the association differs in at least one out of five populations of non-European ancestry. This means that a variant that is associated with diabetes may confer a different risk of disease in someone of European ancestry than in, say, an individual of African ancestry.

What do you reckon is happening in these cases? Is the biology fundamentally different (i.e. compensating alleles)? Is the math broken (i.e. poorly powered post-hoc analyses)?

I caught a glimpse of myself in the reflection of his shiny trophy, that was his kids football trophy, on his desk and my face was RED.  I panicked, but maintained.  The interview began great, easy intro to myself, maybe a little higher than normal energy but everything seemed to be sailing.  I thought the manager was looking at my right breast when I then looked down and noticed both of my armpits sweat through my suit jacket and my thighs felt really really warm.  At this point, Iâm hyped up, sweaty and panicked.  He asked me if I was alright, I gave a wave of my hand like I was a bit hot, stood up to to take my jacket off and accidentally knocked over his kidsâ trophy (slow mo to the ground) and it SMASHED!  It was bad.  We looked at each other in amazement and he politely said that this would not affect the interview but I did have to pay for the trophy to be fixed.  I asked how much and he said tree-fity.",0,t3_8yjgj1,e2ch5vw,1531521123,1536036452,False

&gt; As expected, sleeping less than 7 hours per night was associated with greater heart age relative to actual age; those who slept 5 hours or less per night had an average heart age 1.4 years older than those sleeping 7 hours per night (EHA = 5.1 vs. 3.7, respectively).


&gt; The researchers also found that getting more than 7 hours of sleep per night was linked to greater excess heart age; getting 8 hours of sleep per night was associated with an EHA of 4.5, which was the same as among those getting 6 hours per night.

Abstract

Objectives

Insufficient sleep negatively impacts the cardiovascular system. No study has examined the association between sleep duration and heart age (person's predicted vascular age based on cardiovascular disease [CVD] risk profile). This study examines association between sleep duration and excess heart age (EHA; difference between heart age and chronological age) among US adults.

Design and participants

Cross-sectional 2007-2014 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey data for respondents aged 30-74 years without CVD or stroke (n = 12,775).

Measurements

Self-reported sleep duration was classified into 5 categories (â¤5, 6, 7, 8, and âĽ9 hours). We used sex-specific Framingham heart age algorithm to calculate heart age and multivariable linear regression to examine association between sleep duration and EHA.

Results

A total of 13.4% (95% confidence interval 12.5-14.3), 24.2% (23.1-25.2), 31.0% (29.8-32.3), 25.9% (25.0-26.9), and 5.5% (5.0-6.1) reported sleeping â¤5, 6, 7, 8, and âĽ9 hours, respectively. We observed a nonlinear relationship between sleep duration and EHA using 7 hours as reference: EHA (adjusted for sociodemographics, body mass index, physical activity, Healthy Eating Index-2010, sleep disorder, and depression status) was 5.1 (4.8-5.8), 4.5 (3.9-5.1), 3.7 (3.3-4.0), 4.5 (4.1-5.0), and 4.1 (3.3-4.9) years for sleep durations of â¤5, 6, 7, 8 and âĽ9 hours, respectively (P = .015 for quadratic trend). EHA was significantly higher among participants with lower education, lower income, and obesity.

Conclusion

Mean adjusted EHA was lowest among adults who reported sleeping 7 hours per night and increased as adults reported sleeping fewer or more hours. Discussing sleep duration in the context of EHA may be helpful for patients and clinicians.

27416,27417,"I think I knew this to an extent subconsciously. Obviously, as a maybe poor example, if Im listening to rap while trying to memorize numbers Im going to be a mess. Rap in general was always at the back of my list as the high amount of words and the difficulty to not recite them in my head left me unable to focus on most tasks. This is why I switched to something like EDM or even classical at times. 

I feel like the study left me with more questions than answers, which is still a success. The next step, IMO, is to look at tedious and repetitive tasks and the effect of music on performance. It seems they touched on puzzles, which I think is great, but Im not ready to secede that music can be detrimental to other areas of work. 

As a final step, I think it would be cool to see how performance in these open office settings that are prevalent in the tech industry is affected by music vs general noise throughout the room. I will typically throw headphones in because the traffic in some of my offices was high, and people love to chit chat in my department (sales). Using tech as an example would also be great as it is full of puzzles, memory aspects, tedious and repetitive work (debugging maybe?) and math. ",0,t3_7cj6k6,dpqnns5,1510547203,1512584289,True

Executive control and faithfulness: only long-term romantic relationships require prefrontal control

Experimental Brain Research, March 2018, Volume 236, Issue 3, pp 821â828

Abstract

&gt; Individuals in the early stages of a romantic relationship generally express intense passionate love toward their partners. This observation allows us to hypothesize that the regulation of interest in extra-pair relationships by executive control, which is supported by the function of the prefrontal cortex, is less required in individuals in the early stages of a relationship than it is in those who are in a long-term relationship. To test this hypothesis, we asked male participants in romantic relationships to perform a go/no-go task during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), which is a well-validated task that can measure right ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC) activity implicated in executive control. Subsequently, the participants engaged in a date-rating task in which they rated how much they wanted to date unfamiliar females. We found that individuals with higher right VLPFC activity better regulated their interest in dates with unfamiliar females. Importantly, this relationship was found only in individuals with long-term partners, but not in those with short-term partners, indicating that the active regulation of interest in extra-pair relationships is required only in individuals in a long-term relationship. Our findings extend previous findings on executive control in the maintenance of monogamous relationships by highlighting the role of the VLPFC, which varies according to the stage of the romantic relationship.",21,t3_84lx71,dvqhuxc,1521115603,1525186193,False

27474,27475,"The original coverage of âCheddar Manâ- which was announced in a TV special, not a scientific publication- kept trying to paint him as someone with âblackâ skin.  They even made a model of him looking like an equatorial African.  Just because he didnât have two of the best-known modern alleles contributing to pale skin in Europeans today doesnât mean he was black though. As this article points out, he would have had dark*er* skin like southeast Europeans.  And plenty of non-equatorial populations today have light skin without those two alleles, like the Khoisan of South Africa or many of the East Asian populations.  Blue eyes themselves are thought to come from alleles that contribute to lighter skin.  Moreover, Cheddar Man wasnât representative of Northern Europe at his time (5000 BP).  He was a single specimen, and we know people in southern Scandinavia already were pale and blue-eyed at that point.  

To whit:

&gt;But in the far northâwhere low light levels would favor pale skinâthe team found a different picture in hunter-gatherers: Seven people from the 7700-year-old Motala archaeological site in southern Sweden had both light skin gene variants, SLC24A5 and SLC45A2. They also had a third gene, HERC2/OCA2, which causes blue eyes and may also contribute to light skin and blond hair. Thus ancient hunter-gatherers of the far north were already pale and blue-eyed, but those of central and southern Europe had darker skin.

[Source: the journal *Science*](http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2015/04/how-europeans-evolved-white-skin)

I just think itâs interesting how eagerly the idea of Cheddar man as âthe first modern Britonâ and who looked like an equatorial African was pushed through the media and not through scientific channels.

Further, the tax issue gets silly when the money is **allocated** for a good cause but the state or local government finds itself running short and permanently borrows that money to cover a budget hole.

The above is seen in California's cigarette tax. 

These taxes negatively impact poor people disproportionately. In the cigarette tax it affects poor and homeless people disproportionately while more well off smokers will continue to smoke.

&gt; **Abstract:** Abortion is one of the most divisive policy issues to date. In the last four years, over 250 provisions aimed at restricting access to abortion have been adopted. Publicly funded family planning clinics provide low-cost and free contraception to nearly 1.5 million teens each year. In recent years, several states have considered legislation to defund family planning services, although little is known about how these cuts affect teen pregnancy. This paper fills this knowledge gap by exploiting a policy change in Texas that reduced funding for family planning services by 67 percent and resulted in over 80 clinic closures. I estimate the effects of the funding cuts on teen health outcomes using a difference-in-differences approach that compares the changes in teen birth rates in Texas counties that lost family planning funding to changes in counties outside of Texas with publicly funded clinics. I find that reducing funding for family planning services in Texas increased teen birth rates by approximately 3.4 percent over four years with effects concentrated 2-3 years after the initial cuts.

The study basically says that kids who were suspended early were likely to be suspended again, so therefore suspensions may not be effective at curbing future suspensions.  Thatâs like saying kids who get treated for asthma early on are likely to get treated again, so asthma treatment doesnât work.

The problem is that kids who get suspended early are at high risk for acting out, so they are already as a baseline more likely to act out again as they get older, regardless of whether they are suspended.  Likewise, kids with early asthma symptoms are as a baseline more likely to have future symptoms, so itâs no wonder if they have more symptoms later than other kids who didnât have early symptoms, in spite of treatment.

So to figure out what effect, if any, suspension has, you need a prospective randomized and blinded trial: take the cohort of kids who would have gotten early suspensions, but randomly assign half of them to actually get the suspension, the other half not.  Then see which group gets more suspensions later.  Longitudinal / observational studies are completely useless here.

Another way of looking at this: hereâs a simple model that reveals the flaw in the studyâs reasoning.  Suppose kids who would get suspended early (call this the at-risk group) are 50% likely to get suspended again when they get older.  Suspending them in kindergarten may reduce this figure to, say, 20%.  Now, if kids who never would have gotten suspended early (call this the control group) are 10% likely to get suspended when they are older, then yes the at-risk group is twice as likely to get suspended later as the control group is, even after serving an early suspension.

**Abstract** :

&gt; Sensing with whispering gallery resonators (WGRs) is largely limited by the weak perturbation of the whispering gallery mode (WGM) via the evanescent field. A new sensing regime using quasi-droplet WGMs allows WGRs to move beyond the limitation of the evanescent field and push the detection sensitivity to new heights. We present experimental results on the detection of 100 nm and 500 nm polystyrene particles in aqueous solution using thin-walled, hollow WGRs supporting quasi-droplet modes. The detection sensitivity in terms of mode shift and broadening is measured, with mode shifts of 400 MHz observed for 100 nm particles. In terms of the number of linewidths, this is 276 times larger than similar experiments with microsphere WGRs, thus showing a significant increase in detection sensitivity beyond the capability of standard evanescent field sensing with WGRs.

The two creatures would evolve an almost symbiotic relationship.  Working side by side, one's pro's and con's being outweighed by the others strengths and weaknesses.  Our planet got intelligent monkeys, and intelligent elephants.  The monkeys while smart and dexterous, were weaker, and more deceitful than the strong, lumbering elephants.  Unfortunately as time past, the relationship between Monkey and Elephant never formed.  
	
Our monkey ancestors were to busy thinking of ways to further their own needs than to form an alliance with the Elephants.  While the slow and trustful Wooly Mammoths relaxed and flourished, the deceitful monkeys made tools to off balance their physical weakness and size.  Instead of working with the Mammoths, the monkeys decided to hunt and kill them for food and game. They claimed the world for their own, killing off the other hairy semi-intelligent creatures on the planet.
	
Fast forward 4,000 years.  The Galactic conference of Species lands on Earth.  Out from the space ship, walking in pairs are two very different looking species, who off balance each other almost perfectly.  Once the line of planets finally finishes walking off the ship (we're talking a lot of planets man) they start to look around confused.  Why is there only one species?  Where is the counterpart?  It is then that it dawns on them.  ""They killed off the other one.""

There is, as far as I'm aware, *nothing* wrong with GMOs- aside from a few ""natural"" companies that publish rotten fruit as a comparison without sourcing or any real science as a method. The worst that can be said is the business practice or implementation method. But their largest benefits is the reduction in materials waste and reduction in fungicide/etc., which you'd think everyone, including the ""natural"" crowd, would be supremely in favor of. 

If it weren't for GMOs, and if we went ""all natural"" on an industrial scale with farming, we'd suffer a plague of pests like the world has never seen. Which some might cheer- the downfall of ""industrial farming"" sounds good, until you realise we'll have a malthusian correction in the billions from mass starvation, and even your backyard potatoes wouldn't be safe from. You'd have to guard the roots and seeds with a shotgun day and night from neighbors- you might even fall to starvation yourself. How much you eat greatly outstrips what that theoretical backyard garden of yours can supply. 

The only way we ever cracked 2 billion was mass farming and industrialised equipment, which also freed people from working the farms to start using their productivity elsewhere, moving us even further past sustenance farming.

Yes, the planet might ""be saved"" in the long run from banning all GMOs and industrial farming, but you and over half of humanity literally owe their lives to its existence. To kick it over, should you ever be given such a choice, is to show the ultimate ingratitude, and to make the choice of whether one can live or not for another person, which is tantamount to murder on a mass scale.

The psychology of social class: How socioeconomic status impacts thought, feelings, and behaviour

Abstract

Drawing on recent research on the psychology of social class, I argue that the material conditions in which people grow up and live have a lasting impact on their personal and social identities and that this influences both the way they think and feel about their social environment and key aspects of their social behaviour. Relative to middleâclass counterparts, lower/workingâclass individuals are less likely to define themselves in terms of their socioeconomic status and are more likely to have interdependent selfâconcepts; they are also more inclined to explain social events in situational terms, as a result of having a lower sense of personal control. Workingâclass people score higher on measures of empathy and are more likely to help others in distress. The widely held view that workingâclass individuals are more prejudiced towards immigrants and ethnic minorities is shown to be a function of economic threat, in that highly educated people also express prejudice towards these groups when the latter are described as highly educated and therefore pose an economic threat. The fact that middleâclass norms of independence prevail in universities and prestigious workplaces makes workingâclass people less likely to apply for positions in such institutions, less likely to be selected and less likely to stay if selected. In other words, social class differences in identity, cognition, feelings, and behaviour make it less likely that workingâclass individuals can benefit from educational and occupational opportunities to improve their material circumstances. This means that redistributive policies are needed to break the cycle of deprivation that limits opportunities and threatens social cohesion.",136,t3_8jkpbp,dz0c4oi,1526382535,1527485400,False

28065,28066,"Here's your answer : don't have kids. I don't understand people conveniently avoiding mentioning this and evading it with nonsense about the corporations man. If our number one problem is uncontrolled population growth, then the number one thing that each individual can do to help is to stop having kids. If you already have kids, don't have more. Teach your kids not to have kids. If you're worried about your legacy, don't, because that's literally the reason why you and everyone on this planet won't have one. Accidents might happen and dumb shits will keep breeding but don't actively contribute to that problem. If everyone on earth started recycling, that still won't come close to the impact of if a small but significant percentage of people deliberately stopped breeding. If you're a vegan that produces zero waste but you're pumping out kids, you're still contributing to the single biggest problem. If you're worried about idiocracy, well, we can eventually evolve our smarts back, but if we kill our planet cos we're too scared dumb people (who are people too) will take over, then the jokes on all of us. And the most obvious part is, this has NOTHING to do with the corporations. So. Curb. Your. Loins!

28155,28156,"ExxonMobil knowingly misled the public for decades about the danger climate change poses to a warming world and the company's long-term viability, according to a peer-reviewed study, released on Wednesday, of research and statements by the US oil giant.


An analysis of nearly 200 documents spanning decades found that four-fifths of scientific studies and internal memos acknowledged global warming is real and caused by humans, while the same proportion of hundreds of paid editorials in major US newspapers over the same period cast deep doubt on these widely accepted facts.
The study, published in the journal Environmental Research Letters, also cites ExxonMobil calculations that capping global warming at under two degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit)âthe goal enshrined in the landmark Paris climate accordâwould impose sharp limits on the amount of fossil fuels that could be burned, and thus potentially affect the firm's growth.


Both findings are relevant to ongoing investigations by state and federal attorneys general, along with the Securities and Exchange Commission, on whether the company deceived investors on how it accounts for climate change risk.
Earlier reporting by InsideClimate News, nominated last year for a Pulitzer, unearthed the internal documents and came to much the same conclusion.


In response, the companyâthe largest oil producer in the United States, with revenue of $218 billion dollars (185 billion euros) last yearâdenied having led a four-decade disinformation campaign.
""We unequivocally reject allegations that ExxonMobil suppressed climate change research,"" it said at the time. ""We understand that climate risks are real.""
The company slammed journalists for ""cherry-picked"" data in a way that unfairly put the company in a bad light.
The new study pushes back on that characterisation.
""We looked at the whole cherry tree,"" Geoffrey Supran, a researcher at Harvard University and co-author of the study, told AFP.


 The fossil fuel industry is especially vulnerable to questions about climate risk as the race to decarbonise the world economy g
The fossil fuel industry is especially vulnerable to questions about climate risk as the race to decarbonise the world economy gathers pace
Systemic bias
""Using social science methods, we found a gaping, systematic discrepancy between what Exxon said about climate change in private and academic circles, and what is said to the public.""
As early as 1979, when climate change barely registered as an issue for the public, Exxon was sounding internal alarms.


""The most widely held theory is that... the increase in atmospheric CO2 is due to fossil fuel combustion,"" an internal memo from that year read.
A peer-reviewed study by Exxon scientists 17 years later concluded that ""the body of evidence... now points towards a discernable human influence on global climate.""
At the same time, however, the company was spending tens of millions of dollars to place editorials in The New York Times and other influential newspapers that delivered a very different message.
""Let's face it: The science of climate change is too uncertain to mandate a plan of action that could plunge economies into turmoil,"" Exxon opined in 1997, as the Bill Clinton administration faced overwhelming opposition in Congress to US ratification of the Kyoto Protocol.
Natasha Lamb, managing partner of investment management firm Arjuna Capital, said the new analysis could bolster the lawsuits accusing ExxonMobil of deliberately downplaying climate change risks.
""The Harvard research shows systemic bias in sowing public doubt, while acknowledging the risks privately,"" she said after reviewing the study's main findings.


""That is at the heart of the investigations.""
Lamb's firm filed the first shareholder proposal in 2013 asking ExxonMobil to assess whether a 2C world would result in economically stranded assets.
Those efforts were swatted down, but four years later a decisive 62 percent of shareholders called on ExxonMobil, in a non-binding vote last May, to detail how climate change will affect its future.
In June, a taskforce spearheaded by former New York mayor Michael Bloomberg released guidelines for disclosing corporate exposure to climate change risk, in both in operations and investments.


Launched at the 2015 climate summit in Paris, the transparency measures are designed to show if businesses are aligned with the global shift toward a low-carbon economy, and not unduly burdened with assets that could be stranded during that transition.
The fossil fuel industry is especially vulnerable to questions about climate risk as the race to decarbonise the world economy gathers pace.
From 2006 to 2016, ExxonMobil was led by Rex Tillerson, currently Secretary of State under US President Donald Trump.

28180,28181,"I am but a humble dentist so I cannot speak with great confidence, let alone authority on this subject but I will give my opinion based on my meager knowledge (Mainly based on Guyton's Physiology and some articles I've read).

I have never heard of a single reputable medical institution support the statement that obesity is anything other than detrimental to human health. There is a range of weight in which someone can be healthy and deviating from this range yields increased risk for many problems that , in the case of being overweight, directly correlate to the extra weight.

It's not an unknown, it is extremely well documented that being overweight is a direct factor for a myriad of illnesses, not just  things like diabetes/high blood pressure either. This was even stated in my old pathology textbook (Forget the author atm) as one of the etiological factors in cancer, ateriosclerosis, several forms of arthritis, etc. Cardiomegalia is also greatly affected by obesity and that is irreversible.

I guess what I'm trying to say is, is it really a myth? I've always takent he word ""myth"" to mean fantasy but with a touch of reality to it.... but this? this was always hogwash since the very beginning of the popular phrasing. No one with even the most basic understanding of human physiology could think being overweight is healthy, let alone ""fit"".

EDIT:

Let me clarify that there is a huge difference between ""I'm 5 pounds overweight"" and ""I'm 50 pounds overweight""..... or worse.... people that weight near or above 300 pounds. That is just insanity to try to defend that in terms of health.

It's not a magic wand, it won't cure your depression or anxiety, but it makes them more manageable. As a robust social drinker I stopped drinking alcohol for quite awhile afterward. I became more interested in reading about philosophy, ethics and mathematics, and less obsessed with career moves or arbitrary social status. Overall, I'd say there was a marginal improvement in my top-down executive function, in addition to openness and contentiousness on the Big Five. 

The experience itself was beyond description. Imagine how you feel when your leg falls asleep, now imagine your entire body feels that way, down to every somatosensory neuron. When people describe ""being one with the universe"", your boundaries of where you normally perceive yourself vanish. It's truly an awe-inspiring feeling. Even if maybe perhaps it could be accurately described as white noise from the absense of feedback from the periphery of the body. 

The form constants comprising your visual field decay from geometric shapes to a stochastic blur of colors and fractals. I still consider myself firmly agnostic, but at least in my head, there was God as a spectrum of light comprising colors that aren't in the normal visual sensory range, stretching across the breadth of the universe. It's about as spiritual of an experience as I'll ever feel.

We know that the 5HT-2a receptor this substance acts upon is very promiscuous. I have a hunch it alters our bayesian priors that we use to form a relatively accurate understanding of the world around us.

My 10 year old cattle dog/pit bull mix began waking at night very stressed and pacing. He also started to forget what he was doing (while playing fetch or eating) and would sort of space-out for a few seconds. When I learned that these are actually among the more friendly of several terrible symptoms of canine dementia, I wanted to start him on a treatment right away. My pharmaceutical options had too many side effects for my taste, so I cobbled together a supplement regimen from various advice articles online. 

It consists of:

* Gingko biloba
* Phosphatidylserine
* Bacopa
* Gotu kola
* Turmeric
* Coconut oil
* Omega 3 fish oil
* ""Missing Link"" brand senior supplement powder

28251,28252,"Alright, as the resident antibiotic resistance PhD here, I should chime in.

Since we've known about antibiotic resistance caused by enzymes, the goal has been to find chemicals that could act as enzyme inhibitors, which you could then administer alongside the antibiotic as an [antibiotic adjuvant](http://www.cell.com/trends/microbiology/fulltext/S0966-842X\(16\)30072-5) to restore its activity. This has been successful for some combinations of penicillins with [inhibitors of the penicillin-degrading enzymes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%CE%92-Lactamase_inhibitor), but unfortunately not much else. My own PhD project, an [enzyme](http://www.cell.com/structure/abstract/S0969-2126\(16\)30038-7) that acts on  aminoglycoside antibiotics, is another such target that we haven't yet identified good inhibitors for yet. 

This looks like another step foward for antibiotic adjuvants that can reverse resistance, but I'm always very cautious in my optimism, because the bacteria [always find a way](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMjQ3hA9mEA) around what we might want to throw at them. Nothing is a silver bullet, but I'll make do with some copper ones for now. 

The NDM-1 enzyme made a splash when it was [discovered back in 2009](http://aac.asm.org/content/53/12/5046.full?view=long&amp;pmid=19770275), because it gives resistance to important last-resort antibiotics. Since then it's become a model system for antibiotic resistance as the high profile of the enzyme has made it a target for labs around the world. It's good to see another promising case of new counter-resistance strategies directed toward this enzyme, and I'll be interested in seeing how these inhibitors move forward. It's always a jump to move from mouse models to human trials, but hopefully its successful! We desperately need new clinical options and a high profile new proof of concept for these compounds will be a new breath of fresh air. ",104,t3_5pgmz4,dcrmww6,1485119425,1486270164,False

Explaining recent mortality trends among younger and middle-aged White Americans.

Abstract:

&gt; Background: Recent research has suggested that increases in mortality among middle-aged US Whites are being driven by suicides and poisonings from alcohol and drug use. Increases in these âdespairâ deaths have been argued to reflect a cohort-based epidemic of pain and distress among middle-aged US Whites.

&gt; Methods: We examine trends in all-cause and cause-specific mortality rates among younger and middle-aged US White men and women between 1980 and 2014, using official US mortality data. We estimate trends in cause-specific mortality from suicides, alcohol-related deaths, drug-related deaths, âmetabolic diseasesâ (i.e. deaths from heart diseases, diabetes, obesity and/or hypertension), and residual deaths from extrinsic causes (i.e. causes external to the body). We examine variation in mortality trends by gender, age and cause of death, and decompose trends into period- and cohort-based variation.

&gt; Results: Trends in middle-aged US White mortality vary considerably by cause and gender. The relative contribution to overall mortality rates from drug-related deaths has increased dramatically since the early 1990s, but the contributions from suicide and alcohol-related deaths have remained stable. Rising mortality from drug-related deaths exhibit strong period-based patterns. Declines in deaths from metabolic diseases have slowed for middle-aged White men and have stalled for middle-aged White women, and exhibit strong cohort-based patterns.

&gt; Conclusions: We find little empirical support for the pain- and distress-based explanations for rising mortality in the US White population. Instead, recent mortality increases among younger and middle-aged US White men and women have likely been shaped by the US opiate epidemic and an expanding obesogenic environment.

Some people seem so eager to leave Earth for Mars yet they don't understand how extremely inhospitable its atmosphere is and the amount of time it will take to successfully colonize it. 

We still need to develop methods of recreating a suitable atmosphere for vegetation as well as single and multi-cellular organisms. Am I saying it can't be done? No, I just think when some people talk about interplanetary space travel they don't realize that we are still many years away from actually being able to successfully carry out pre-arrival planetary microbial regeneration. At the same time, I think some of our intentions are extremely selfish; there is a notion that we've used up the Earth to the extent that we can so we need to start moving people to other worlds so we can start everything from scratch?

The major finding here is the endothelial module - getting transplants to vasularize is key to survival, and is particularly important to beta cells as they are highly metabolically active.

Curing diabetes with whole islet transplantation has been around for decades now and is not novel, the obvious problem is it takes two to three human donors to cure a type 1. Stem cell derived methods are coming but not ready. 

The major issue is type 1 generates a significant and lasting immune response to islet cells so transplantation doesn't last without systemic immunosuppression. You'll notice that's why they used mice without a functional immune system instead of NOD or a better diabetes model. ",6,t3_6u8qs1,dlrcsmr,1502990091,1504145965,False

Not necessarily gonna be movement.  Detection is more complicated than that.  The child seat often stays installed, although IIRC many are a separate mount for the child seat and the child and seat may (but not necessarily) be taken out together.

So, you could imagine a seat with an occupancy sensor, but it would probably have to be based on weight.  This may be difficult to ever be reliable.  The seat may outweigh the baby, and it could easily false-trigger from problems getting ""zeroed"" or by leaving blankets or something on it.

Also a problem, a weight sensor is a load cell like 1.5"" square and 1/4"" deep.  They work when the weight is bearing down on the load cell.  Problem is, we need the seat and child to be held down tightly with belts, not floating on a load cell where it would just rip off in an accident.

And of course there's a problem about the general environment- many of the parents are driving older cars with the lowest-cost child seat because it's what they can afford.  So adding a high-tech ""ChildSave"" feature to the Tesla which uses a $1500 auto-child-sense seat may be pioneering, but not a meaningful overall solution.

I don't see how the study is answering this chicken or egg question. Common sense and personal experience tells me I am more likely to cuddle after sex with someone I already love/like than with a random FWB. 

Has there ever been a study sampling thousands of couples that declaratively hated each other/were strangers before, were subjected to a regimented schedule of sex + mandatory affection, and came out of it happier over a consistently defined and long time period?

Since the genesis of the concept of hyperuniformity in the early 2000s, hyperuniform patterns of organization have been found all over nature, including in the eyes of chickens, quasicrystals, distributions of random numbers, quantum ensembles of particles, and even the large-scale structure of the universe.

For example, students in the history courses were taught how to identify logical fallacies - statements that violate logical arguments, such as non sequiturs.

At the beginning of the semester, students in all three courses took a baseline assessment of their beliefs in pseudoscientific claims. The assessment used a scale from 1 (""I don't believe at all."") to 7 (""I strongly believe."").

Some of the topics in the assessment, such as belief in Atlantis, were later addressed in the ""historical frauds"" course. Other topics, such as the belief that 9/11 was an ""inside job,"" were never addressed in the course. This allowed the researchers to determine the extent to which changes in student beliefs stemmed from specific facts discussed in class, versus changes in a student's critical thinking skills.

At the end of the semester, students took the pseudoscience assessment again.

The control group students did not change their beliefs - but students in both history courses had lower beliefs in pseudoscience by the end of the semester.

Students in the history course for honors students decreased the most in their pseudoscientific beliefs; on average, student beliefs dropped an entire point on the belief scale for topics covered in class, and by 0.5 points on topics not covered in class. There were similar, but less pronounced, changes in the non-honors course.

Abstract

Background

Some country guidelines recommend that people with type 2 diabetes (T2D) limit their consumption of eggs and cholesterol. Our previously published 3-mo weight-maintenance study showed that a high-egg (âĽ12 eggs/wk) diet compared with a low-egg diet (&lt;2 eggs/wk) did not have adverse effects on cardiometabolic risk factors in adults with T2D.

Objective

The current study follows the previously published 3-mo weight-maintenance study and assessed the effects of the high-egg compared with the low-egg diets as part of a 3-mo weight-loss period, followed by a 6-mo follow-up period for a total duration of 12 mo.

Design

Participants with prediabetes or T2D (n = 128) were prescribed a 3-mo daily energy restriction of 2.1 MJ and a macronutrient-matched diet and instructed on specific types and quantities of foods to be consumed, with an emphasis on replacing saturated fats with monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats. Participants were followed up at the 9- and 12-mo visits.

Results

From 3 to 12 mo the weight loss was similar (high-egg compared with low-egg diets: â3.1 Âą 6.3 compared with â3.1 Âą 5.2 kg; P = 0.48). There were no differences between groups in glycemia (plasma glucose, glycated hemoglobin, 1,5-anhydroglucitol), traditional serum lipids, markers of inflammation [high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, interleukin 6, soluble E-selectin (sE-Selectin)], oxidative stress (F2-isoprostanes), or adiponectin from 3 to 12 mo or from 0 to 12 mo.

Conclusions

People with prediabetes or T2D who consumed a 3-mo high-egg weight-loss diet with a 6-mo follow-up exhibited no adverse changes in cardiometabolic markers compared with those who consumed a low-egg weight-loss diet. A healthy diet based on population guidelines and including more eggs than currently recommended by some countries may be safely consumed.

Summary:

&gt; Background

&gt; Long-term intraocular injections of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-neutralising proteins can preserve central vision in many patients with neovascular age-related macular degeneration. We tested the safety and tolerability of a single intravitreous injection of an AAV2 vector expressing the VEGF-neutralising protein sFLT01 in patients with advanced neovascular age-related macular degeneration.

&gt; Methods

&gt; This was a phase 1, open-label, dose-escalating study done at four outpatient retina clinics in the USA. Patients were assigned to each cohort in order of enrolment, with the first three patients being assigned to and completing the first cohort before filling positions in the following treatment groups. Patients aged 50 years or older with neovascular age-related macular degeneration and a baseline best-corrected visual acuity score of 20/100 or less in the study eye were enrolled in four dose-ranging cohorts (cohort 1, 2âĂâ108 vector genomes (vg); cohort 2, 2âĂâ109 vg; cohort 3, 6âĂâ109 vg; and cohort 4, 2âĂâ1010 vg, n=3 per cohort) and one maximum tolerated dose cohort (cohort 5, 2âĂâ1010 vg, n=7) and followed up for 52 weeks. The primary objective of the study was to assess the safety and tolerability of a single intravitreous injection of AAV2-sFLT01, through the measurement of eye-related adverse events. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01024998.

&gt; Findings

&gt; 19 patients with advanced neovascular age-related macular degeneration were enrolled in the study between May 18, 2010, and July 14, 2014. All patients completed the 52-week trial period. Two patients in cohort 4 (2 Ăâ1010 vg) experienced adverse events that were possibly study-drug related: pyrexia and intraocular inflammation that resolved with a topical steroid. Five of ten patients who received 2âĂâ1010 vg had aqueous humour concentrations of sFLT01 that peaked at 32Âˇ7â112Âˇ0 ng/mL (mean 73Âˇ7 ng/mL, SD 30Âˇ5) by week 26 with a slight decrease to a mean of 53Âˇ2 ng/mL at week 52 (SD 17Âˇ1). At baseline, four of these five patients were negative for anti-AAV2 serum antibodies and the fifth had a very low titre (1:100) of anti-AAV2 antibodies, whereas four of the five non-expressers of sFLT01 had titres of 1:400 or greater. In 11 of 19 patients with intraretinal or subretinal fluid at baseline judged to be reversible, six showed substantial fluid reduction and improvement in vision, whereas five showed no fluid reduction. One patient in cohort 5 showed a large decrease in vision between weeks 26 and 52 that was not thought to be vector-related.

&gt; Interpretation

&gt; Intravitreous injection of AAV2-sFLT01 seemed to be safe and well tolerated at all doses. Additional studies are needed to identify sources of variability in expression and anti-permeability activity, including the potential effect of baseline anti-AAV2 serum antibodies.",15,t3_6bolz4,dho8whz,1495027158,1496596404,False

If thousands of ""people"" report something, it must be true right? 

With the majority of people getting their news from the headlines of social media posts, being able to manipulate what they see is a great power. It is the literally the power to manipulate the opinions and emotions of millions of people with a single post. You could create a movement with that kind of power if you desired.

Significance

Although oil palm cultivation represents an important source of income for many tropical countries, its future expansion is a primary threat to tropical forests and biodiversity. In this context, and especially in regions where industrial palm oil production is still emerging, identifying âareas of compromise,â that is, areas with high productivity and low biodiversity importance, could be a unique opportunity to reconcile conservation and economic growth. We applied this approach to Africa, by combining data on oil palm suitability with primate distribution, diversity, and vulnerability. We found that such areas of compromise are very rare throughout the continent (0.13 Mha), and that large-scale expansion of oil palm cultivation in Africa will have unavoidable, negative effects on primates.

Î9-Tetrahydrocannabinol at Retrieval Drives False Recollection of Neutral and Emotional Memories,

Biological Psychiatry, 2018, ISSN 0006-3223

Abstract: 

Background

It is well established that the main psychoactive constituent of cannabis, Î9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), impairs episodic memory encoding and modulates emotional processing, but little is known about the impact of THC during the retrieval of emotional episodic memories. With the rise of cannabis to treat medical conditions, including those characterized by emotional and episodic memory disturbances, there is an urgent need to determine the effects of THC on memory accuracy and distortion. Here, we report the first study investigating the effects of THC during retrieval of neutral and emotional episodic memories.

Methods

Using a double blind, placebo-controlled, within-subjects design, healthy volunteers (N = 23) viewed negative, neutral, and positive pictures (emotional memory task) and lists of semantically related words (false memory task). Forty-eight hours later, participants ingested a capsule containing either THC (15 mg) or placebo and completed tasks to test their memories for the previously studied pictures and words.

Results

THC during retrieval did not reduce the number of correct responses to studied items. Instead, it robustly increased false recollection on both the emotional memory and false memory tasks. This effect was found for both neutral and emotional items.

Conclusions

These findings show that THC has adverse effects during memory retrieval, distorting both neutral and emotional memories. Coupled with THCâs known effects during encoding, these new retrieval findings are important in light of the spreading acceptance of cannabis.

Read the article carefully.

&gt; When patients get an initial opioid prescription thatâs just a one-day supply, they have about a six-percent chance of being on opioids for a year or longer. But if that first prescription is for a three-day supply, the probability of long-term use starts inching up. With an initial five-day supply, the chance jumps to about 10 percent. With a six-day supply, the chance hits 12 percent. With 10-dayâs worth, the odds of still being on opioids a year later hits roughly 20 percent.

Did you catch how worthless this was?

Let's go back and rewind.

Imagine you're looking at a population of people. They're being prescribed painkillers for a wide variety of reasons. Some of them are being prescribed painkillers after an accident. Some of them are being prescribed painkillers for post-surgical pain. Some of them are being prescribed painkillers because of some form of serious injury which takes a long time to heal, such as, say, a shattered femur. Some of them are being prescribed opioids to deal with long-term pain.

Thus, you will have the largest number of people who are prescribed opioids for just one day. The longer the prescriptions are made out for, the fewer people there are - by definition, because you're eliminating the people with the shorter prescriptions.

So at 1 day, you're just looking at people who were injured or whatever and needed something.

At 7-10 days, you're looking at people who were prescribed painkillers for post surgical pain.

The longer the duration, the higher the fraction of those who remain were prescribed opioids for long-term pain.

But the particular fractions mean *nothing*. You're really just comparing how many people were prescribed opioids for various reasons.

It tells you nothing about addiction.",2,t3_606k0i,df4cmtt,1489900547,1491605657,False

What about animals? Even though a cat or a cow or a pig might look very similar to another (perhaps the siblings it is standing beside) with practice it's easy to differentiate them. Part of that is facial recognition but another part seems to be ""body recognition"" and another part ""personality recognition"". In humans a gait, posture, activity and obviously their voices and what they say can differentiate one from another even in a crowd and when facial features are not visible.

If the above is quantified by security or social researchers such as yourself, how is it quantified? Seems to me if we could analyse non-facial features that we could identify persons with a certain degree of accuracy. Might be useful if persons take radical steps (e.g. cosmetic surgery) or are wearing sunglasses, hats, disguises, have facial hair, have headphones and hoodies etc, to be able to make an ID with whatever confidence interval.

Summary:

&gt; Background

&gt; Exenatide, a glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist, has neuroprotective effects in preclinical models of Parkinson's disease. We investigated whether these effects would be apparent in a clinical trial.

&gt; Methods

&gt; In this single-centre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, patients with moderate Parkinson's disease were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive subcutaneous injections of exenatide 2 mg or placebo once weekly for 48 weeks in addition to their regular medication, followed by a 12-week washout period. Eligible patients were aged 25â75 years, had idiopathic Parkinson's disease as measured by Queen Square Brain Bank criteria, were on dopaminergic treatment with wearing-off effects, and were at Hoehn and Yahr stage 2Âˇ5 or less when on treatment. Randomisation was by web-based randomisation with a two strata block design according to disease severity. Patients and investigators were masked to treatment allocation. The primary outcome was the adjusted difference in the Movement Disorders Society Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) motor subscale (part 3) in the practically defined off-medication state at 60 weeks. All efficacy analyses were based on a modified intention-to-treat principle, which included all patients who completed any post-randomisation follow-up assessments. The study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01971242) and is completed.

&gt; Findings

&gt; Between June 18, 2014, and March 13, 2015, 62 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned, 32 to exenatide and 30 to placebo. Our primary analysis included 31 patients in the exenatide group and 29 patients in the placebo group. At 60 weeks, off-medication scores on part 3 of the MDS-UPDRS had improved by 1Âˇ0 points (95% CI â2Âˇ6 to 0Âˇ7) in the exenatide group and worsened by 2Âˇ1 points (â0Âˇ6 to 4Âˇ8) in the placebo group, an adjusted mean difference of â3Âˇ5 points (â6Âˇ7 to â0Âˇ3; p=0Âˇ0318). Injection site reactions and gastrointestinal symptoms were common adverse events in both groups. Six serious adverse events occurred in the exenatide group and two in the placebo group, although none in either group were judged to be related to the study interventions.

&gt; Interpretation

&gt; Exenatide had positive effects on practically defined off-medication motor scores in Parkinson's disease, which were sustained beyond the period of exposure. Whether exenatide affects the underlying disease pathophysiology or simply induces long-lasting symptomatic effects is uncertain. Exenatide represents a major new avenue for investigation in Parkinson's disease, and effects on everyday symptoms should be examined in longer-term trials.

Last thought, I also had a friend who was diagnosed with ADHD in the U.S ARMY who let me have 2-3 weeks of his Ritalin to see if it would help me and it made 0 difference, so I found that extremely odd. I felt 100% normal / no difference while taking the medication.
  

Edit: I also was never a problem child / trouble maker / attention seeker. I am only adding this, due to constantly seeing parents blaming their ill-tempered / bad mannered children on having ADHD and that's the reason.

I hope that you all find it useful :)!
Paleontologist here,
I'd just like to say a few things based on the comments I'm seeing here:
 
First off, my qualifications: My current advisor is the third author on this paper and I worked under (and collaborated with) the second author when I worked at the San Diego Natural History Museum (in fact, I re-prepared some of the material in this paper about 6 years ago). Furthermore, I am a doctoral student in the final months (hopefully) of my PhD. My dissertation work has been on proboscideans (elephants and their relatives), but I have also done a fair amount of work on cetaceans (whales) and other vertebrates.
 
As far as the dating methods go, this site was dated using multiple types of absolute dating methods, which all resulted in a very similar age. However, the Uranium-series dating (not to be confused with radiocarbon dating, which could not give you an accurate age this old) that was used here got results with a very high confidence. In fact there is essentially no evidence of alteration that might lead to an older date (which really would not be common anyways). The dates recovered are almost unimpeachable (and I don't say that lightly). I would be very surprised if a geochronologist or any other expert had a major problems with the dates themselves (in fact a geochronologist was a reviewer for this paper for just this reason). Also, to the people that are saying that it is perhaps time to reassess our methods of isotopic dating in general, I strongly suggest you spend more time researching and trying to understand these methods before you make a claim like this...
 
One other misconception that I keep seeing here are peoples' interpretation of what is meant by ""human"" in this paper. ""Human"" is meant here in the sense of a species of the genus Homo, not necessarily Homo sapiens specifically. In fact, because of the old age it seems fairly unlikely that this would be the modern species of human rather than some other [unknown] species.
 
I'm sure there will be other questions or comments here throughout the next day or so, and I will try to check in from time to time and update this post. I'm also happy to answer any questions that I can (to the best of my knowledge).
 
Hope this is at least somewhat helpful!
 
Edit 1: To the folks wondering if this site could have been scavenged by humans (as opposed to hunted), I would say that, that is absolutely possible. In fact there is really no evidence one way or another to argue for hunting over scavenging at this site, and I don't believe that this paper takes a stance on this either. In fact, I would say that the argument of hunting vs scavenging in association with this mastodon is somewhat irrelevant. What is important is that this extremely old site (relatively speaking, anyways) has fairly clear association with ancient human activity.
 
Edit 2: Several people have pointed out that the article discusses a lack of evidence of meat stripping on the specimen. This does suggest scavenging, as it likely means the soft tissue was at least somewhat rotted and not usable.
 
Edit 3: Many people are suggesting that this animal could have been scavenged or had its bones modified many thousands of years after its death (i.e., implying the tools are much younger than the mastodon). To that point 1) the type of breakage seen on these bones is indicative of damage while the bone was still fresh. Fresh bone (sometimes called ""green bone"") breaks in a very different ""spiral pattern"" than older dried out bone; and 2) you have to remember that the sediments that the tools and mastodon are found in represent the context in which they were buried. Therefore since these materials were all found within the same layer they must have been buried at the same time. It is possible that ancient humans exhumed old bones (though I know of no actual evidence of this), but we would see telltale signs of disturbance to the sediment (which was not observed here).
In other words, I don't think that arguments about this site will come down to whether the material is associated and coeval, but whether folks think that these artifacts are indeed stone tools. Those people who do not agree with this identification will then have to reconcile the crazy taphonomy at this site and attribute it to some other natural process (which will be no small feat, IMHO).
 
Edit 4: For the people asking why we don't have any evidence of humans (or human remains) in North America in the time between the age of this site and more generally accepted dates:
First off, I would just like to note that we are almost certainly not talking about a direct lineage of humans between the time of this site and those of Clovis times (in fact, as I've stated above, we are likely not even talking about the same species). This was likely a very small population of humans that made it to North America that probably died out long before the modern species of human ever made it over. In that sense, there isn't necessarily a gap of time to ""bridge"".
As for why potential sites might not be preserved: There are a couple of reasons that you might not have evidence of humans found from this time. First off, you may not have rocks of the right age readily exposed in the region where the individuals were living (which is somewhat the case on the west coast, as far as I am aware). Second, the individuals could be living in an environment that is not conducive to preserving fossils (e.g., organisms that live in montane environments tend to not preserve in the fossil record because sediments are not being deposited in those regions). Third, getting preserved in the fossil record (in general) is very rare, and if your study organism has a very small population size or is short lived (as we would expect in the case here) then you have a very very low probability of being preserved (let alone found and collected). Finally, even if these scenarios aren't the case, there is the possibility that scientists have just been looking in the wrong strata, region, or age.",3,t3_6z1mw8,dmrrfmm,1504963191,1506626130,False

Currently not taking any medications. I've been told I have ADHD, bipolar 1 (which they bounce between this and borderline personality disorder), PTSD and GAD. My major issues are memory and focus which are caused by (in my opinion) the inner monologue in my head. I hate saying ""the voice in my head distracts me"" because people go ""oh shit you're like really crazy"" but I'M my inner voice - telling me how the world is about to end and reminding me of all my failures. Inner me is really mean and overly critical. Inner me also likes to exaggerate things and make them worse than they really are. I KNOW the world isn't literally about to end - but my mind still plays through every worst case scenario in any situation.

I have tried medications and therapy and distraction techniques (meditation) but nothing shuts down the running narrative inside my head. I'm not a danger to myself or others, it's nothing like that. I just want silence! Do you have any advice? I would greatly appreciate any help since my newest therapist sees me as a pill seeker and does not help me at all.",8,t3_6u9kuy,dlr59zy,1502982309,1504142290,False

Also, the new earth theory, while often accompanied by the belief that evolution is not real, is really not related. They are two separate claims. Evolution tells us that evolution has happened within the last 4000 years - so even if the new earthers were right, that doesn't mean evolution is not occurring.

28784,28785,"My one son's preschool class isn't just peanut free â it is also pea, chickpea, and dairy free. That's right, dairy free, because there is a child in the class who has an anaphylactic allergy to dairy. The kid isn't even in his class, but because the different preschool classes share the same facility, all the classes are affected. This means that in addition to peanut-butter, I can't send him yogurt or cheese, so the three protein sources that he eats readily are not options. Considering that he is not a child who loves meat, this has made his preschool meals impossible. I just feed him a good one before he goes and then send him applesauce and other fruits because that is pretty much what we are limited to because of this kid. I get being sensitive about allergies when there is a large (comparatively) group affected by a single food, but when your child's allergies force a drastic change to the regular diet of every other child in the classroom, it becomes a problem for me. I'm the one taking on the cost of trying to find nut-free peanut butter substitutes, I'm somehow responsible for the cost of getting the more expensive dairy-free granola bars, I'm the one taking on the frustration of trying to come up with creative lunches that my child will eat in a large, relatively unsupervised group. 

My suspicion is that this ban will not continue once the kids join the larger school, as they can't enforce an entire K-6 facility to become dairy free for one kid. The best they can do is require all kids to wash their hands before and after eating (which is a good idea anyways, is it reduces the transmission of illness as well as potential allergens), and the kid will have to become more responsible for protecting themselves from accidental contact through good hand washing, not touching their face/mouth, eating at a carefully cleaned desk. The rest of the world isn't going to ban peanuts and dairy, so any contact with surfaces in public areas carries the potential for coming into contact with allergens.

A brief and simple explanation of the hypothesis goes like this: Red blood cells (RBCs) can only absorb ascorbate in its oxidized form called dehydroascorbic acid (DHAA). DHAA transporters are also glucose transporters. High blood glucose levels in diabetics compete for the transporters, leading to low RBC ascorbate. This deficiency then leads to structural and biochemical changes in the RBCs that might explain some aspects of vascular disease in diabetics.

The only difference between this and the type of interface used in a patch clamp system is that the two electrode systems have different electrochemical potentials so that when they're shorted together while in contact with a given ionic system, the potential difference drives a current.

 Either of the two electrodes could just as easily have been used for both ends of the ionic circuit, and the current driven by a normal battery. This would offer greater control, since the current could easily be driven in either polarity. 

Moreover, nether vanadium nor lithium sound biologically inactive. I _know_ lithium salts are biologically active. It seems like it would be far more desirable to use a reference electrode style interface with a biologically neutral or relevant ionic species, rather than driving a vanadium current and using an ion exchange membrane to trade it for a sodium or potassium current or whatever is desired. 

Dunno, cute, but not particular flexible or useful seeming. Only use case I can see is reduction in component count or device volume for something that needs to drive a constant ionic current, which does not include most of the applications mentioned (which need modulated current). 

Edit; well, I guess you could interrupt the electrical part of the circuit with the circuitry that's supposed to do the modulating and use the exact same current to power both the modulator and the biological activity.

Engineers from the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) have successfully developed an artificial neural network using 3D printing. The physical device is reportedly capable of analyzing large amounts of data and identifying objects at the speed of light and could have important applications in autonomous vehicles and more.

Developed by a team of electrical and computer engineers, the small 3D printed device may not look like much on its own. In fact, it looks quite simply like a series of small square polymer sheets lined up in front of one another. But these polymer layers (measuring 8 x 8 cm) are really something special.

Let there be light
As the researchers explain in a press release, while many devices today have the ability to identify objects, they mostly rely on cameras or optical sensors to capture the initial data of the object. The 3D printed AI network, however, utilizes a âdiffractive deep neural networkâ which is capable of identifying an object simply by the light bouncing off of it. This means that it can identify the object as quickly as it would take an optical sensor-based device to simply âseeâ it.â

Moreover, because it does rely on optical sensors, the UCLA device does not require any advanced computing programs to process images of the object. Since the artificial neural network uses diffraction of light to understand its surroundings, it also does not consume any energy.

âThis work opens up fundamentally new opportunities to use an artificial intelligence-based passive device to instantaneously analyze data, images and classify objects,â explained Aydogan Ozcan, principal investigator of the study and Chancellor of Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering at UCLA. âThis optical artificial neural network device is intuitively modelled on how the brain processes information. It could be scaled up to enable new camera designs and unique optical components that work passively in medical technologies, robotics, security or any application where image and video data are essential.â

Decreases in Psychological Well-Being Among American Adolescents After 2012 and Links to Screen Time During the Rise of Smartphone Technology.

Abstract:

&gt; In nationally representative yearly surveys of United States 8th, 10th, and 12th graders 1991â2016 (N = 1.1 million), psychological well-being (measured by self-esteem, life satisfaction, and happiness) suddenly decreased after 2012. Adolescents who spent more time on electronic communication and screens (e.g., social media, the Internet, texting, gaming) and less time on nonscreen activities (e.g., in-person social interaction, sports/exercise, homework, attending religious services) had lower psychological well-being. Adolescents spending a small amount of time on electronic communication were the happiest. Psychological well-being was lower in years when adolescents spent more time on screens and higher in years when they spent more time on nonscreen activities, with changes in activities generally preceding declines in well-being. Cyclical economic indicators such as unemployment were not significantly correlated with well-being, suggesting that the Great Recession was not the cause of the decrease in psychological well-being, which may instead be at least partially due to the rapid adoption of smartphones and the subsequent shift in adolescentsâ time use.

&gt;Eating disorders (EDs) are serious health conditions that are among the most difficult to treat. Innovative treatments are needed and modalities from across cultures must be considered. Ayahuasca is a psychoactive plant-based tea originally used by Amazonian indigenous groups. A growing body of research points to its promise in the healing of various mental health issues. This study explored the potential therapeutic value of ayahuasca in the context of EDs, including the perceived impact of the preparatory diet and the ayahuasca purge. Sixteen individuals previously diagnosed with an ED participated in a semi-structured interview relating to their experiences with ceremonial ayahuasca drinking. Interviews were analyzed using thematic analysis. Themes presented relate to the reduction or cessation of ED and mental health symptoms, shifts in body perception, and the importance of a ceremonial setting and after-care. For some, the preparatory diet resulted in familiar patterns of concern; however, none felt triggered by the purge in ayahuasca. Ceremonial ayahuasca drinking shows promise in the healing of EDs and warrants further research.",7,t3_72kdz7,dnj6uit,1506436484,1507114657,False

Correlation is not causation people. It's simply likely that people who tend to be obese all tend to have heart conditions and health problems. Potentially heart conditions and health problems are what lead to people sitting around and having less physical activity, burning less calories and eating more because they can't engage in other activities and storing more of their caloric intake as fat.

What this is really about is giving people an excuse for fat shaming and hating overweight people. 

Even if the results are taken as causation the increase in liklihood for a health problems is anywhere from 50% to 200%. That means if your risk was 1 out 100 for a heart attack your risk is now 2 out of a 100. And undoubtedly this will be used by hateful redditors to shame anyone who is overweight. All while skinny people chugging mountain dew and drinking alcohol and playing video games ignore the health risks involved in those activities.

Some important take aways from the article that will get gleaned over. 

&gt;âFor the very large number of people who are overweight or mildly obese, I donât think itâs doomsday if they can keep themselves out of the low fitness level,â Dr. Lavie said.

&gt;Dr. Caleyachetty, the author of the new paper, agreed that the lack of information about fitness and exercise was âan important caveat.â

&gt;âThose people who are metabolically healthy, obese and vigorously active may have a decreased risk of developing cardiovascular disease,â he conceded.

&gt;That doesnât mean that weight trumps all. Indeed, the study found that individuals who were considered to be of normal weight but who had a single risk factor such as diabetes, high blood pressure or high cholesterol were actually at greater risk for coronary heart disease than the healthy obese people.

I would think this is at least a 2-3year program, with 25lbs a safe drop per year. The dieter would have to drop weight safely over a 2-month period, then maintain it for another 12 months at least. 

If i understand the article correctly, once the dieter has a year at the ""new normal"" weight, the body is not trying to regain the missing weight. 

So would it then be a good time to begin the second drop? 

Or would you think there'd be a progressive, continual drop over the course of the year? If 50lbs is a target, could that first year actually drop more than 25lbs safely and ""permanently""?

I have until the end of May to finish up my thesis re-submission and I'm probably going to end up throwing away 4 years of work due to depression an anxiety surrounding my PhD.

I started in 2010 and by 2013 I'd become so anxious and emotional due to fear of failure and perceived lack of interest in my work from my supervisors, I was recommended anti-depressants and a some time away by my doctor.  Since then I've had several extensions, submitted my thesis to a less-than-flattering viva and have been told to resubmit after major changes.

In that time I became increasingly self-destructive towards my relationships with my wife, friends and family, and with my work. I also have become reclusive due to embarrassment, as the majority of my friends are PhD graduates that seemed to have a relatively easy time of it.

In late 2014, I took a graduate position at a software company and my day-to-day mental state has improved dramatically. I still get the occasional day or week of feeling anxious, helpless or generally upset, but avoiding thinking about my thesis and how I've wasted so many years tends to keep that at bay. I work with people a good 4-5 years younger than me and I am a similar number years behind where someone of my age _should_ be in my career. But I'm happier.

Basically, my PhD broke me and has had a significant negative impact my ability to feel comfortable and enjoy life. I have a lot of support from my wife and family and I do feel like I can get better if I can just put it all behind me. The worry of explaining a 4 year gap in my CV to a potential new employer is scary but I'll cross that bridge when I come it it.

Sorry for the long, rambling post but it feels good to get this off my chest. Reading that my problems aren't uncommon makes me feel vindicated in some respects.

My advice to any aspiring PhD students would be to not be embarrassed to ask for help and if you feel you need it, ask for it early. Don't let it spiral out of control and cause significant damage to your health and well-being. I feel like I'd be in a dramatically different place right now if I followed my own advice.

- I didn't see it mentioned in the text, but what was the effect size/odds ratio for the individual SNPs you investigated with regards to mucosal autoimmune disease? How does the effect size/p-value change if you create a quantitative trait for ""T-bet"" binders/non-binders?

- In the text, you argue that T-bet is important for specifying the Th1 lineage in CD4+ T-cells. My recollection, though, is that T-bet contributes to gene regulatory programs in multiple immune cell types - including CD8s, innate lymphoid cells, NK cells, and subsets of Tregs and Th17 cells. Have you investigated any of these cell populations? Or do you see this as a mostly Th1-driven phenomenon? To my knowledge, Th1 cells are not required for disease pathogenesis in EAE-type models, but T-bet is.

- What are the minor allele frequencies for rs1465321 and the other SNPs with the strongest evidence for impacting T-bet binding? Have you thought about what sort of evolutionary pressures may have been (or still are) driving selection on these sites? Maybe something to do with pathogenic immunity?

Some studies have found correlations between physiology of people and their sexuality; these studies provide evidence which suggests that:

    Gay men and straight women have, on average, equally proportioned brain hemispheres. Lesbian women and straight men have, on average, slightly larger right brain hemispheres.[68]
    The suprachiasmatic nucleus of the hypothalamus was found by Swaab and Hopffman to be larger in gay men than in non-gay men,[69] the suprachiasmatic nucleus is also known to be larger in men than in women.[70][71]
    Gay men report, on an average, slightly longer and thicker penises than non-gay men.[72]
    The average size of the INAH 3 in the brains of gay men is approximately the same size as INAH 3 in women, which is significantly smaller, and the cells more densely packed, than in heterosexual men's brains.[45]
    The anterior commissure is larger in women than men and was reported to be larger in gay men than in non-gay men,[41] but a subsequent study found no such difference.[73]
    Gay men's brains respond differently to fluoxetine, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor.[74]
    The functioning of the inner ear and the central auditory system in lesbians and bisexual women are more like the functional properties found in men than in non-gay women (the researchers argued this finding was consistent with the prenatal hormonal theory of sexual orientation).[75]
    The startle response (eyeblink following a loud sound) is similarly masculinized in lesbians and bisexual women.[76]
    Gay and non-gay people's brains respond differently to two putative sex pheromones (AND, found in male armpit secretions, and EST, found in female urine).[38][77][78]
    The amygdala, a region of the brain, is more active in gay men than non-gay men when exposed to sexually arousing material.[79]
    Finger length ratios between the index and ring fingers have been reported to differ, on average, between non-gay and lesbian women.[80][81][82][83][84][85][86][87][88][89]
    Gay men and lesbians are significantly more likely to be left-handed or ambidextrous than non-gay men and women;[90][91][92] Simon LeVay argues that because ""[h]and preference is observable before birth...[93] [t]he observation of increased non-right-handness in gay people is therefore consistent with the idea that sexual orientation is influenced by prenatal processes,"" perhaps heredity.[45]
    A study of over 50 gay men found that about 23% had counterclockwise hair whorl, as opposed to 8% in the general population. This may correlate with left-handedness.[94]
    Gay men have increased ridge density in the fingerprints on their left thumbs and little fingers.[94]
    Length of limbs and hands of gay men is smaller compared to height than the general population, but only among white men.[94]

___

&gt;**Abstract**

&gt;Growing body of literature has developed to detect the role of ocean heat uptake and transport in the recent warming slowdown between 1998â2013; however, the atmospheric footprint of the slowdown in dynamical and physical processes remains unclear. Here, we divided recent decades into the recent hiatus period and the preceding warming period (1983â1998) to investigate the atmospheric footprint. We use a process-resolving analysis method to quantify the contributions of different processes to the total temperature changes. We show that the increasing rate of global mean tropospheric temperature was also reduced during the hiatus period. The decomposed trends due to physical processes, including surface albedo, water vapour, cloud, surface turbulent fluxes and atmospheric dynamics, reversed the patterns between the two periods. The changes in atmospheric heat transport are coupled with changes in the surface latent heat flux across the lower troposphere (below approximately 800 hPa) and with cloud-related processes in the upper troposphere (above approximately 600 hPa) and were underpinned by strengthening/weakening Hadley Circulation and Walker Circulation during the warming/hiatus period. This dynamical coupling experienced a phase transition between the two periods, reminding us of the importance of understanding the atmospheric footprint, which constitutes an essential part of internal climate variability.",5,t3_5xrebs,dekasft,1488776065,1491245880,False

**Abstract**
 
&gt; *Puberty is an important developmental event that is marked by the reorganizing and remodeling of the brain. Exposure to stress during this critical period of development can have enduring effects on both reproductive and non-reproductive behaviors. The purpose of this study was to investigate age and sex differences in immune response by examining sickness behavior, body temperature changes, and serum cytokine levels following an immune challenge. The effects of circulating gonadal hormones on age and sex differences in immune response were also examined. Results showed that male mice display more sickness behavior and greater fluctuations in body temperature following LPS treatment than female mice. Moreover, adult male mice display more sickness behavior and a greater drop in body temperature following LPS treatment compared to pubertal male mice. Following gonadectomy, pubertal and adult males displayed steeper and prolonged drops in body temperature compared to sham-operated counterparts. Gonadectomy did not eliminate sex differences in LPS-induced body temperature changes, suggesting that additional factors contribute to the observed differences. LPS treatment increased cytokine levels in all mice. However, the increase in pro-inflammatory cytokines was higher in adult compared to pubertal mice, while the increase in anti-inflammatory cytokines was greater in pubertal than in adult mice. Our findings contribute to a better understanding of age and sex differences in acute immune response following LPS treatment and possible mechanisms involved in the enduring alterations in behavior and brain function following pubertal exposure to LPS.*",4,t3_5wnlqt,debvepf,1488304224,1489214148,False

&gt; Researchers 3D print prototype for âbionic eyeâ


&gt; A team of researchers at the University of Minnesota have, for the first time, fully 3D printed an array of light receptors on a hemispherical surface. This discovery marks a significant step toward creating a âbionic eyeâ that could someday help blind people see or sighted people see better.

Abstract

Extrusionâbased 3D printing, an emerging technology, has been previously used in the comprehensive fabrication of lightâemitting diodes using various functional inks, without cleanrooms or conventional microfabrication techniques. Here, polymerâbased photodetectors exhibiting high performance are fully 3D printed and thoroughly characterized. A semiconducting polymer ink is printed and optimized for the active layer of the photodetector, achieving an external quantum efficiency of 25.3%, which is comparable to that of microfabricated counterparts and yet created solely via a oneâpot custom built 3Dâprinting tool housed under ambient conditions. The devices are integrated into image sensing arrays with high sensitivity and wide field of view, by 3D printing interconnected photodetectors directly on flexible substrates and hemispherical surfaces. This approach is further extended to create integrated multifunctional devices consisting of optically coupled photodetectors and lightâemitting diodes, demonstrating for the first time the multifunctional integration of multiple semiconducting device types which are fully 3D printed on a single platform. The 3Dâprinted optoelectronic devices are made without conventional microfabrication facilities, allowing for flexibility in the design and manufacturing of nextâgeneration wearable and 3Dâstructured optoelectronics, and validating the potential of 3D printing to achieve highâperformance integrated active electronic materials and devices.

Additionally new climate forces in particular the solar vafiability impact and previously unknown earth feedback loops have been more extensively studied indiciating there is  a lot of reason to beleive that co2 is by no means the dominant climate determinant.

Indeed as the originator of the co2 theory said himself back in the 1970's  there was far more data needed before adopting .

We do have good evidence thatthe earht has survived farmore climate variabikity without going into irreversible greenhouse venus mode giving storng ststistically evidence from millions of years that there are earth forces which resist such an outcome very effecticely.

In facta bigger worry is evidence of global cooling now appearing coinciding with solar minimums which have stalked the historical records more than warming events..even after huge global forest fires releasing massive amounts of co2 into the atmosphere.

Data is from:

&gt;In this work we analyse data from the DrugAge database [10], which contains information about chemical compounds and their effect on the lifespan of organisms

Methodology:

&gt;This type of method was chosen because it is particularly popular in bioinformatics [21,22], it is robust to overfitting in datasets where the number of features is much larger than the number of instances (as with our dataset) [22,23], it is relatively simple to understand and to use, and finally, in contrast to other state-of-the-art classification methods like support vector machines, random forests produce interpretable results based on a variable (feature) importance measure, an interpretation mechanism also exploited in this paper.

&gt;In order to evaluate the predictive relevance of these two types of features, we created three different datasets: one using as predictive features only the GO terms, another using as predictive features only the chemical descriptors, and a third dataset using both types of features

Results:
&gt;Acrolein (lifespan increase class probability = 0.69) was the top hit in our screening dataset. 

&gt;Other compounds affecting mitochondrial processes include valinomycin and cardiolipin (both with lifespan increase class probability = 0.64)

&gt;Anti-cancer compounds from our top 50 hits in the DGIdb dataset include drugs such as temsirolimus, valspodar and bortezomib. Interestingly, temsirolimus (lifespan increase class probability = 0.62) is a derivative and pro-drug of sirolimus â also known as rapamycin.

Abstract

Selective hunting can affect demographic characteristics and phenotypic traits of the targeted species. Hunting systems often involve harvesting quotas based on sex, age and/or size categories to avoid selective pressure. However, it is difficult to assess whether such regulations deter hunters from targeting larger âtrophyâ animals with longer horns that may have evolutionary consequences.

Here, we compile 44,088 annually resolved and absolutely dated measurements of Alpine ibex (Capra ibex) horn growth increments from 8,355 males, harvested between 1978 and 2013, in the eastern Swiss Canton of Grisons. We aim to determine whether male ibex with longer horns were preferentially targeted, causing animals with early rapid horn growth to have shorter lives, and whether such hunting selection translated into longâterm trends in horn size over the past four decades.

Results show that mediumâ to longerâhorned adult males had a higher probability of being harvested than shorterâhorned individuals of the same age and that regulations do affect the hunters' behaviour. Nevertheless, phenotypic traits such as horn length, as well as body size and weight, remained stable over the study period.
Although selective trophy hunting still occurs, it did not cause a measurable evolutionary response in Grisons' Alpine ibex populations; managed and surveyed since 1978. Nevertheless, further research is needed to understand whether phenotypic trait development is coinfluenced by other, potentially compensatory factors that may possibly mask the effects of selective, longâterm hunting pressure.",14,t3_8l0p7a,dzbwg8b,1526908452,1527770404,False

Future moms: No, you do not need to *eat for two* in pregnancy.  Seriously, follow the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommendations for weight gain during pregnancy, which is based on your BMI.


&gt;Pre-pregnancy Weight/Recommended Weight Gain


&gt;Underweight (Less than 18.5 BMI)- 28-40 lbs (1-1.3 lbs/wk in 2/3 trimester)


&gt;Normal Weight (18.5-24.9)- 23-35 lbs (.8-1 lbs/wk)


&gt;Overweight (25-29.9)- 12-25 lbs (.5-.7 lbs/wk)

Seriously, you need to control your diet in pregnancy.  Dont just assume, More weight is better.  You put you and your baby at more risk if you overdo it.  I had a patient last week with a BMI over 40 and mom spent two hours after full dilation/effacement pushing the the baby in the birth canal.  And the baby was only 6 lbs...all the extra weight on mom just didnt help things.  She had *fun*...and the epidural doesnt work on the birth canal, folks.  


Also, there are *serious* emergencies that can go wrong during delivery (like shoulder dystocia) that we cant really predict before we start pushing which can maim your baby for life.  And even if your baby is alright, if you try to deliver a fat baby, youre more likely going to tear your vag and need to get sewn back up (hopefully you dont tear all the way to your rectum).


Obesity makes your pregnancy *so much more complicated and high risk*.  So eat smart.  Track your weight.  Follow your OB/GYNs advice.  Both you and baby will be better off for it.


EDIT *P.S. Get the epidural...youll wish you got the epidural.  Youre not impressing us because you want to tough it out.  If we can hear your pre-labor moaning and wailing at the staff desk, were probably silently smirking at you.  We do this every day.  Anesthesiologists/CNRAs know what theyre doing.

Well I sure hope so. Doctors don't stay up to date on what therapies actually work for patients. They get caught buying into pharmaceuticals that aren't even approved to help their patients and forcing their experiments on patients. They also misprescribe dosage and add extra drugs instead of trying to figure out what the actual issue is when treatments don't work. Doctors are also irresponsible enough to misdiagnose major heart conditions, like heart attacks, in the first place. That means the applied treatments aren't even for the issue the patient's having. 

This should be AI's job. It should be AI's job to diagnose &amp; implement treatments as they're the most consistent method to use now.

29385,29386,"Did a research paper on shrooms and LSD being used as an alternative to other psychiatric medication years ago and found them to be pretty successful IF you can control the dosage to fit the need.

Some particular successful results were regarding domestic violence cases where men had badly beaten or even murdered their family members.  In these cases, the subject was put into a safe room with nothing but a chair, table and a two way mirror for observation.  The subject was then given a high level dosage of LSD-25 (normally in a cup of water) and left alone until the drug started to take effect.
Once the subject started showing the effects of the drug, a therapist would enter the room and start talking with the subject about the loved ones he had hurt, showing photos of the family member and encouraging the subject to recall good stories about past memories.  Once the subject started to open up and be responsive to the positive input, the therapist would present photos/video or case files from the abuse or crime.  This typically had a crushing emotional impact on the subject as psychedelic drugs effectively remove ones sense of Ego or as this article states ""authoritarianism"".  If you can strip away a persons Ego, then changing their habits becomes infinitely easier.
Unfortunately, medical experimentation with LSD-25 and Psilocybin was pretty much squashed in the early 80's, it's good to see an interest in it again.

29419,29420,"I've always wondered about the properties of the Ergosphere on a rotating black hole, and the opportunities it might provide with regards to experiments relating to FtL travel.

From my understanding, the Ergosphere is the region just outside the event horizon where -thanks to the mass of the rotating black hole - spacetime itself gets ""dragged along"", which results in objects in the ergosphere *appearing* to go faster than light for outside observers.

It seems to me then, that if one were to slingshot an object past a black hole, in and out of the ergosphere, the object would appear to have gone faster than light, and it seems like it wouldn't be much of a stretch to set up an experiment this way in which we violate casualty, or appear to violate casualty for a specific (fast moving) observer.

So is my understanding wrong? Am i missing some key point that prevents us from violating causality? Do we have any idea what *would* happen if we were to set up such an experiment?

So, with things like anxiety and depression, we know that there are associated neurotransmitter imbalances, right?  Except we don't entirely know WHY those imbalances occur.  We think it has something to do with the body's stress response (as in how it responds when it is injured or diseased, including things like systemic inflammation) being out of whack.  But why is the stress response out of whack?

Well, there's a ton of potential reasons.  One avenue of research is gut bacteria.  There are a ton of good things that most of the bacteria in the gut do, and it's possible they have an impact on the body's stress response.

My own lit review paper for that class was looking at the connection between diet and anxiety/depression.  Primarily looking at the impacts of high fat diets on the development of those conditions.  While a lot more research needs to be done, it looks like there may be a connection.  The prevailing theory being that somehow, high fat diets impact the expression of certain neurotransmitter receptors within the limbic system, which in turn impacts the activation of the body's stress response, which in turn results in anxiety/depression.

- [Surprise! Scientists find signs of new brain cells in adults as old as 79](http://www.latimes.com/science/sciencenow/la-sci-sn-new-brain-cells-20180405-story.html)

&gt;In a report published Thursday in Cell Stem Cell, scientists from Columbia University present new evidence that our brains continue to make hundreds of new neurons a day, even after we reach our 70s, in a process known as neurogenesis.
&gt;
&gt;Previous research had shown that neurogenesis slows down in aging mice and nonhuman primates. Boldrini's group wanted to see whether a similar pattern occurred in humans.
&gt;
&gt;These new findings were published one month after a team of researchers from UC San Francisco reported in Nature that it was unable to find any evidence of neurogenesis after adolescence in humans at all.

Abstract

The invasive Burmese python (Python bivittatus) has been reproducing in the Florida Everglades since the 1980s. These giant constrictor snakes have caused a precipitous decline in small mammal populations in southern Florida following escapes or releases from the commercial pet trade. To better understand the invasion pathway and genetic composition of the population, two mitochondrial (mtDNA) loci across 1,398 base pairs were sequenced on 426 snakes and 22 microsatellites were assessed on 389 snakes. Concatenated mtDNA sequences produced six haplotypes with an average nucleotide and haplotype diversity of Ď = 0.002 and h = 0.097, respectively. Samples collected in Florida from morphologically identified P. bivittatus snakes were similar to published cytochrome oxidase 1 and cytochrome b sequences from both P. bivittatus and Python molurus and were highly divergent (genetic distances of 5.4% and 4.3%, respectively). The average number of microsatellite alleles and expected heterozygosity were NA = 5.50 and HE = 0.60, respectively. Nuclear Bayesian assignment tests supported two genetically distinct groups and an admixed group, not geographically differentiated. The effective population size (NE = 315.1) was lower than expected for a population this large, but reflected the low genetic diversity overall. The patterns of genetic diversity between mtDNA and microsatellites were disparate, indicating nuclear introgression of separate mtDNA lineages corresponding to cytonuclear discordance. The introgression likely occurred prior to the invasion, but genetic information on the native range and commercial trade is needed for verification. Our finding that the Florida python population is comprised of distinct lineages suggests greater standing variation for adaptation and the potential for broader areas of suitable habitat in the invaded range.",8,t3_9bsr5v,e55ei0q,1535714593,1538515872,False

29568,29569,"Careful. Food rules like this can backfire.

Here is my personal story:

My father and his wife required me to eat vegetables.  And no, I don't mean ""try a bite""... I did that, I tried a bite of every vegetable they ever made and was completely repulsed and disgusted. They made me gag.  I did not like the taste and it actually sickened me.  

Despite this, at every meal my step-mother made certain that she prepared a vegetable as part of the meal.  As we all know, in the course of a year, there are bound to be certain meals that just naturally don't have a vegetable as a normal part of the meal.  Such as a hot dog and potato chips.  However, she made damn sure that she prepared a vegetable *every time*.

I did not like vegetables. I did not ask for any to be place on my plate. I did not want any.  Despite this, they would place a serving of that meal's vegetable dish on my plate and they would demand that I eat them.  I couldn't stand the vegetables and I refused to eat them and make myself gag and wretch.  

Their solution was that I was made to stay sitting at the dinner table with the plate in front of me until the vegetables had been eaten.  However, I wouldn't do it.  As such, from the time I was 9 years old (this is when my Dad married my step-mother) I would sit down at the dinner table at around 6pm each night and I would be forced to stay sitting there until 11pm every night, which was my bedtime.  When 11pm came, my Dad would come and take the plate and tell me to go to bed.  He would then place that plate into the refrigerator.

When I came to breakfast the following morning, that same plate would be removed from the refrigerator and would be set in front of me again.  I was told that I would get no other breakfast until the vegetables on the plate were eaten first.  Again, I would not do it and so, I would sit there until time to go outside to the bus stop for school.  At this point, they would throw away the serving of vegetables that I had not eaten and the same cycle would occur again that night.  

The only meal I had each day where I was not molested was lunch at school.  This cycle of sitting at the table every night until 11pm and getting the same plate again in the morning continued until I graduated high school and I left the state to go to college, three months prior to my 18th birthday.

Since leaving their house, I have not eaten any vegetables.  And, even if my taste buds have changed with age and possibly I might even like vegetables now... I will never know.  Because after that was done to me, I will be goddamned if I will ever touch a vegetable again in my lifetime.

All this to say, sure... make your kids try a bite of vegetables. But, if they do not want them, do not force them to eat it... that can backfire in a big way.

29600,29601,"In the paper, the authors suggest six reasons for why they think their approach will succeed where a great many others have failed. This is important to stress - the literature is replete with stories where the investigator thought they had discovered a tractable way to drug the plaques associated with neurodegenerative disorders only to discover that after a long and expensive clinical trial, their drug had no impact on disease progression.

&gt; The potential advantages are: 

&gt; 1) a diminished risk of inducing auto-immune complications since the immunogen used has no sequence homology to any human peptide/protein (except to the protein expressed in the very rare patients with British amyloidosis) 

&gt; 2) selective targeting of the Î˛-sheet secondary structure found in toxic oligomers, thus avoiding interference with the multiple physiological functions of soluble AÎ˛, tau and Îą-synuclein

&gt; 3) reduced risk of inducing vasogenic edema/encephalitis related to direct clearance of fibrillar AÎ˛ vascular deposits, since mainly oligomeric forms of AÎ˛ and tau are being targeted

&gt; 4) concurrently targeting AÎ˛, tau and Îą-syn related pathologic conformers, addressing the mixed pathologies found in the majority of NDD patients49,50,51,52

&gt; 5) minimal risk of increasing toxic oligomer species as shown with some vaccination methods53

&gt; 6) possible therapeutic use in prion diseases with the potential to interfere with the spread of PrPRes. 

&gt; No other reported methodologies to produce mAbs to oligomers published thus far, has this unique combination of properties. Hence we believe that our technological approach has the potential to develop tools for the detection, monitoring and treatment of multiple NDD.

The major thrust of their argument seems to be 1) that their antibodies are more specific to the pathological oligomers, relative to non-pathological forms of the proteins as normally expressed by the cell and 2) that the approach can be broadly applied to multiple NDDs.

Assuming this is true (not clear to me that it is), this is good - but dose limiting toxicity from on target/off pathology effects is not the driver of clinical failure in NDDs. Unfortunately, this doesn't move the needle for me very much in terms of confidence that treatment with these antibodies will be better than any other form of targeting Abeta or similar plaque pathologies in other NDDs.

What Do Workplace Wellness Programs Do? Evidence from the Illinois Workplace Wellness Study

Damon Jones, David Molitor, Julian Reif

NBER Working Paper No. 24229

DOI: 10.3386/w24229

Link: http://www.nber.org/papers/w24229.pdf

Abstract:

Workplace wellness programs cover over 50 million workers and are intended to reduce medical spending, increase productivity, and improve well-being. Yet, limited evidence exists to support these claims. We designed and implemented a comprehensive workplace wellness program for a large employer with over 12,000 employees, and randomly assigned program eligibility and financial incentives at the individual level. Over 56 percent of eligible (treatment group) employees participated in the program. We find strong patterns of selection: during the year prior to the intervention, program participants had lower medical expenditures and healthier behaviors than non-participants. However, we do not find significant causal effects of treatment on total medical expenditures, health behaviors, employee productivity, or self-reported health status in the first year. Our 95% confidence intervals rule out 83 percent of previous estimates on medical spending and absenteeism. Our selection results suggest these programs may act as a screening mechanism: even in the absence of any direct savings, differential recruitment or retention of lower-cost participants could result in net savings for employers.

However, I think it's critical for anyone emotionally invested in clinical/counseling psychology (or psychotherapy in a more general sense) as a tool for helping people with disorders should spend a decent amount of time at the beginning of their education, and then regularly through their career, becoming comfortable with the *very real* possibility that the following ideas could be come solid realities in your lifetime:

1. Psychotherapy, no matter how brilliant, might be shown to have firm limits on its effectiveness.
2. What you currently believe about the effectiveness of psychotherapy might be completely wrong.
3. Something else might come along and make psychotherapy completely irrelevant (like maybe direct brain changes, super drugs, implants, etc.).

If these ideas are too threatening to consider seriously (e.g., if you find yourself arguing with them and saying, ""But that will never happen!""), then I don't think you have much business being a therapist. Your emotional attachment to a *method* of helping people, instead of to the act of helping, or to the people themselves, is kind of like a computer programmer proclaiming that BASIC is the best computer programming language ever, and human programmers will always be critically needed.

The history of psychotherapy has already smacked us in the face several times with highly disillusioning information like this--the initial psychotherapy effectiveness studies in the late 70s, the quick dominance of CBT over most ""big"" schools of thought, the ascendancy of eclecticism as it became clear that none of our individual theories of therapy did very well on its own--and science will continue to hammer away at our egos.

29780,29781,"I am really glad for this study.

However, I want to point out here a little annoyance I have with obvious studies like these (or certain anti-vax studies) is that it still takes both manpower and money.

If you are spending money and manpower (especially if it's scientific manpower) on this study then you're not spending money on a study that could be actually useful such as investigating AIDS or cancer treatments the cures for which are really only limited by the amount of investment.

Also, although a lot of people will say this will disprove the 'non-believers' forget that facts only work when trying to argue with someone who is also using facts. If you are arguing with someone's ideas or beliefs then bringing facts is pointless (That is not to say that arguing a belief is wrong and that sometimes you have to argue with just thoughts and feeling).

So really, at the end of the day, studies like these are a drain on spending and productivity and deliver nothing of value and this could have been concluded in the planning meeting before this even started.

What they could/should have done, if they wanted to attempt to sway ideology onto the side of safer sex, is to run a study to figure out the root cause of the ideological issues with safer sex, the range of complaints that are being addressed, and the most influential people to target. Then action could have been taken to bring those people together into an understanding.


For example; The complaint isn't against safety, it was against the possible increase of teen sex (or at least as far as I can tell). Perhaps if the hospitals offered to hand out the vaccine after a sermon was delivered to explain that just because they were protected physically doesn't mean they were protected spiritually.
Of course this is merely a compromise off the top of my head and don't actually expect this to work. The point is that this is the sort of action that could have been devised from a well constructed study and would have the chance to work whereas, as I said before, bring yet another study to an emotional argument is pretty much pointless.",-11,t3_9avu6v,e4z0lrv,1535461998,1538014533,False

Simply starting school later in the day does not add hours to a day. You still only have 24 hours to work with.

Firstly, parents drop their kids off at school before work. So, if work starts at 8 AM, the kids need to be dropped off with plenty of time to spare to get through traffic to work. Sure there are buses and bikes. However, in the U.S., at least where I live, you have to live at least 2 miles away from the school to get picked up by a bus. In addition to that, some parents have their kids go to schools outside of the ""jurisdiction"" (i.e. private school, charter school, district transfers, etc). At the school my son goes to, kindergartners and first graders are not allowed to be ""by themselves."" If they walk/bike home, they have to have an older sibling or a parent walk them. If they bus home, an older sibling or parent has to meet them at the bus stop. So, if the young child has no older siblings, the parent(s) must either drive them to school, walk them, escort to/from bus stop.

Secondly, let's talk extracurriculars. It gets dark pretty early before Daylight Saving in March. You can't just push outdoor extracurriculars forward an hour or two. Besides, like I said, pushing the wake time forward doesn't add hours to the day. You still have to do homework, study, do extracurriculars, have dinner, etc.

Thirdly, how about jobs? That's right. Not all you teens have to support the family, but there are plenty who do. And some states have laws on how late school-going teens can stay at work. So, if school hours are pushed forward, that means Teenager A can't be at work at 3:30, it now has to be 4:30 or 5:00.

Anyway, to be honest, I probably don't empathize much because when I was a teen, I went to bed at 9 pm and went to high school with a start time of 7:30 am. I never had much trouble getting up and going to school. I got out of school by 2:30, and had plenty of time to do whatever it is I had to do, and get back to bed by 9. I guess that's not necessarily true for all teens, but I really don't think a 9 am or 10 am start to school is the solution.

&gt; **Introduction:** Active resistance is considered to be the ânormalâ reaction during rape. However, studies have indicated that similar to animals, humans exposed to extreme threat may react with a state of involuntary, temporary motor inhibition known as tonic immobility. The aim of the present study was to assess the occurrence of tonic immobility during rape and subsequent post-traumatic stress disorder and severe depression.
&gt; 
&gt; **Material and methods:** Tonic immobility at the time of the assault was assessed using the Tonic Immobility Scale in 298 women who had visited the Emergency clinic for raped women within 1 month of a sexual assault. Information about the assault and the victim characteristics were taken from the structured clinical data files. After 6 months, 189 women were assessed regarding the development of post-traumatic stress disorder and depression.
&gt; 
&gt; **Results:** Of the 298 women, 70% reported significant tonic immobility and 48% reported extreme tonic immobility during the assault. Tonic immobility was associated with the development of post-traumatic stress disorder (OR 2.75; 95% CI 1.50â5.03, p = 0.001) and severe depression (OR 3.42; 95% CI 1.51â7.72, p = 0.003) at 6 months. Further, previous trauma history (OR 2.36; 95% CI 1.48â3.77, p &lt; 0.001) and psychiatric treatment history (OR 2.00; 95% CI 1.26â3.19, p = 0.003) were associated with the tonic immobility response.
&gt; 
&gt; **Conclusions:** Tonic immobility during rape is a common reaction associated with subsequent post-traumatic stress disorder and severe depression.

https://www.niaid.nih.gov/news-events/combination-hiv-antibody-infusions-safely-maintain-viral-suppression-select-individuals

A small group of people living with HIV sensitive to two potent anti-HIV broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) (link is external)â3BNC117 and 10-1074âtolerated multiple infusions of the antibodies and suppressed HIV for more than 15 weeks after stopping antiretroviral therapy (ART). The new findings, from a pilot clinical trial supported by the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation and others, are reported today in Nature.

âA safe, reliable, antibody-based treatment regimen would open new possibilities for people living with HIV,â said Anthony S. Fauci, M.D., director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, part of NIH.



Yes, that's about all this study did. It established that multiple infusions were tolerated and we're safe. That's it. Anything else is overextrapolating.


The only time a trial with such a small cohort ever gives information on whether or not a treatment is working that early in clinical trials is when you have to deal with extremely rare or single patient population indications.

Three important points there that I would want to see data on before claiming we actually know what's going on.

I don't think we've seen if extra body fat is the actual problem or if it's the typical diet that leads people to become overweight. For instance, is an overweight person at more, less, or the same risk if they eat a typical Western diet, heavy on animal products, or a plant-based diet?

Is specifically body**fat** or just extra mass in general that is the problem (i.e. fat mass, versus muscle mass)? BMI isn't useful for people with more than average muscle.

For example, neuronal plaque is an inconsistent marker of dementia--some with dementia don't have it and some who have it, don't have dementia!--though, it is reliably present in Alzheimer's enough that it was pursued.  Nonetheless, reducing plaques doesn't slow alzheimers!  In fact, it may have a semi-protective function (for the record, the plaques are toxic, but nonetheless, there are toxic lesser of two evils processes all over the natural world).

With telomeres you have a lot of issues.  Telomere extension has been semi-successful, BUT immortal cell lines are magnitudes more likely to become cancerous.  

There is also the (admittedly far less likely) possibility that those with longer telomeres are more likely to exercise. 

I wonder the following:

Does exercise increase telomere length within a single person?

Among those already predisposed to longer telomere length, does exercise augment their telomeres more or less?

Following from above, does telomere length predict life expectancy independently of those measures of fitness in the first place?

Edit: Though there has been research in the literal extension of telomere length, I misspoke highly here, as the question is the rate of shortening, not their extension.",103,t3_6ae6xc,dhef9nz,1494463071,1496426016,False

Abstract: 

&gt; OBJECTIVE

&gt; To examine the accuracy of home blood pressure (BP) devices, on their owners, compared to auscultatory reference standard BP measurements.

&gt; METHODS

&gt; Eighty-five consecutive consenting subjects âĽ18 years of age, who owned an oscillometric home BP device (wrist or upper-arm device), with BP levels between 80â220/50â120 mm Hg, and with arm circumferences between 25â43 cm were studied. Pregnancy and atrial fibrillation were exclusion criteria. Device measurements from each subjectâs home BP device were compared to simultaneous 2-observer auscultation using a mercury sphygmomanometer. Between-group mean comparisons were conducted using paired t-tests. The proportion of patients with device-to-auscultatory differences of âĽ5, 10, and 15 mm Hg were tabulated and predictors of systolic and diastolic BP differences were identified using linear regression.

&gt; RESULTS

&gt; Mean age was 66.4 Âą 11.0 years, mean arm circumference was 32.7 Âą 3.7 cm, 54% were female and 78% had hypertension. Mean BPs were 125.7 Âą 14.0/73.9 Âą 10.4 mm Hg for home BP devices vs. 129.0 Âą 14.7/72.9 Âą 9.3 for auscultation (difference of â3.3 Âą 7.3/0.9 Âą 6.1; P values &lt;0.0001 for systolic and 0.17 for diastolic). The proportion of devices with systolic or diastolic BP differences from auscultation of âĽ5, 10, and 15 mm Hg was 69%, 29%, and 7%, respectively. Increasing arm circumference was a statistically significant predictor of higher systolic (parameter estimate 0.61 per cm increase; P value 0.004) and diastolic (0.38; 0.03) BP.

&gt; CONCLUSIONS

&gt; Although mean differences from 2-observer auscultation were acceptable, when tested on their owners, most home BP devices were not accurate to within 5 mm Hg. Ensuring acceptable accuracy of the device-owner pairing should be prioritized.",2,t3_6gkq7g,dir0oms,1497176949,1499249419,False

**Importance**  Players of American football may be at increased risk of long-term neurological conditions, particularly chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE).

**Objective**  To determine the neuropathological and clinical features of deceased football players with CTE.

**Design, Setting, and Participants**  Case series of 202 football players whose brains were donated for research. Neuropathological evaluations and retrospective telephone clinical assessments (including head trauma history) with informants were performed blinded. Online questionnaires ascertained athletic and military history.

**Exposures**  Participation in American football at any level of play.

**Main Outcomes and Measures**  Neuropathological diagnoses of neurodegenerative diseases, including CTE, based on defined diagnostic criteria; CTE neuropathological severity (stages I to IV or dichotomized into mild [stages I and II] and severe [stages III and IV]); informant-reported athletic history and, for players who died in 2014 or later, clinical presentation, including behavior, mood, and cognitive symptoms and dementia.

**Results**  Among 202 deceased former football players (median age at death, 66 years [interquartile range, 47-76 years]), CTE was neuropathologically diagnosed in 177 players (87%; median age at death, 67 years [interquartile range, 52-77 years]; mean years of football participation, 15.1 [SD, 5.2]), including 0 of 2 preâhigh school, 3 of 14 high school (21%), 48 of 53 college (91%), 9 of 14 semiprofessional (64%), 7 of 8 Canadian Football League (88%), and 110 of 111 National Football League (99%) players. Neuropathological severity of CTE was distributed across the highest level of play, with all 3 former high school players having mild pathology and the majority of former college (27 [56%]), semiprofessional (5 [56%]), and professional (101 [86%]) players having severe pathology. Among 27 participants with mild CTE pathology, 26 (96%) had behavioral or mood symptoms or both, 23 (85%) had cognitive symptoms, and 9 (33%) had signs of dementia. Among 84 participants with severe CTE pathology, 75 (89%) had behavioral or mood symptoms or both, 80 (95%) had cognitive symptoms, and 71 (85%) had signs of dementia.

**Conclusions and Relevance**  In a convenience sample of deceased football players who donated their brains for research, a high proportion had neuropathological evidence of CTE, suggesting that CTE may be related to prior participation in football.",412,t3_6pgpym,dkp4yri,1500995319,1501554332,False
